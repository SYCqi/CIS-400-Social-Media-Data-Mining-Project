1,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

I'm a journalist for the Kansas News Service and KCUR (public radio). I'm looking for people to interview for a story on losing power during severe weather in July and January. I know some lost power for days in July after the massive wind storm knocked down trees. Did anyone who lost power then also lose power in January?

If anyone is willing to share their experiences with me for a radio news story, I would love to hear them. You can message me here or send me an email at [dlysen@kcur.org](mailto:dlysen@kcur.org).

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

5,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

6,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00

8,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

15,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

20,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

21,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
22,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover.

23,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

30,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
31,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, love",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier.

Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone.

When a Hutchinson substitute teacher started drawing whimsical characters on the public sidewalk in front of her apartment this week, she thought people would smile − and they did − mostly.  
Kara Vaughn of Hutchinson, who teaches art at Hutchinson Middle School, loves to  draw with chalk − a substance that can be washed off with water or rain.  
But to Vaughn's surprise her landlord was upset by her drawings. She allegedly told her that she was being disrespectful and she needed to clean up the drawings immediately.  
Vaughn had posted her drawings on TikTok (under Varakaughn) and had gotten positive remarks from people across the country − she didn't want to clean them up, but she did. Then she called the city of Hutchinson and was told there is no ordinance about drawing appropriate pictures with chalk on  public sidewalks.  
The News confirmed with the city that no such ordinance exists, so children can keep drawing those hop-scotch boards and tic-tac-toe  games.  
For Vaughn it's relaxing. She said she loves being out with her dog and drawing − even though when it rains, her artwork disappears.  
""I  scraped it off, and then I posted it, and it just went everywhere (on TikTok),"" she said. ""I've been a pretty like go with the flow person. But I have so much support and engagement and love from the TikTok community, it gave me a lot of confidence to go ahead and stick up for myself.""  
Since Vaughn started posting her Disney-like, Pokémon-like chalk drawings on TikTok and the controversy she is having with her landlord about it, her profile has increased and she has garnered more than 8 million views from across the country.  
But Vaughn is scared of being kicked out of her apartment over this.  
""They haven't said that they were going to try to evict me,"" she said. ""It feels like she wants me out. I'm afraid that something is going to happen. I don't know. I just I really don't do good with confrontation.""  
Still, Vaughn is determined to beautify the city, hoping others will join the fun. She said she would like to have a special chalk day for all of Hutchinson. She is trying to get a day started. She is also hoping her landlords will grow to understand the beauty in the drawings.",2023-06-05 23:08:06+00:00

But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

50,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching.

52,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

53,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch.

If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36.

His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching.

Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald.

73,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, annoying",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient.

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
99,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, comfortable",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

I'm a journalist for the Kansas News Service and KCUR (public radio). I'm looking for people to interview for a story on losing power during severe weather in July and January. I know some lost power for days in July after the massive wind storm knocked down trees. Did anyone who lost power then also lose power in January?

If anyone is willing to share their experiences with me for a radio news story, I would love to hear them. You can message me here or send me an email at [dlysen@kcur.org](mailto:dlysen@kcur.org).

111,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, love",Thanks for all your replies- visiting today!,"Hi! I posted about a week ago about opinions on KCK vs. KC. We are really leaning to the KCK area to relocate to with our four kiddos ages 7, 10, 14, 15 from Florida. I got a plethora of incredibly thoughtful replies, thank you all so much. 

We would be leaving my aging parents behind in FL and I feel rather guilt-ridden and sad about that (they are healthy but in their 70s and this is unrelated to my post but it feels like abandonment and my dad isn’t taking it well) but other than that and leaving our friends it is a great opportunity that could change our lives in wonderful ways. 

I am flying up in literally in two hours, last minute before the storm brewing in the gulf, with my eldest sons. I wanted to bring them first for some solo time bc they are the most rooted here and will be entering 9th,10th grade. My husband and two youngest will join us in a few days. 

All that said what should we see? We definitely plan to drive around the neighborhoods many of you suggested to get a feel. Go to parks. Eat some bbq and steak. Open to going into KC too. They are into soccer, video games, music, the usual stuff! 

Would love to give them a bit of a slice of life there. We are all excited but a little scared. 

Also, if any of you want to suggest or dm me name of a therapist that might help me with some of my guilt feelings and transition process id really appreciate it❤️

113,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, love",[KS] Rental Lease Issue Concerning Possible Unsafe House,"


I am renting a house from a private homeowner through a Property Management company. It has been discovered that a basement wall is collapsing, and it was discovered because of a water leak I found during a storm. The contractor that came to look said it appears they tried to patch the leak several times before, but because the foundation of the house is shifted so badly, water will get in during any storm that’s bad enough. The wall is against the backyard, and to fix the wall they would need to excavate the backyard and replace the limestone currently there with the appropriate material. During my 6-month walkthrough, the Prop. Management employee said they are discussing with the homeowner terminating the lease, since he is not wanting to pay the $30,000 to fix this wall. 

With that being said, I began looking for another place to rent and told her I was going to move. Last week, I went to finalize the plan for this, and she informed the homeowner does not want to break the lease, he would rather explore the option of installing a pump to get water out of the basement. The first of several issues is; there is no actual water in the basement outside of inclement weather, and even then it is 3 fairly small leaks in the basement, one around the water heater, one in the corner of the collapsing wall, and one on a wall with drywall. The pump would not fix the wall, or the shifting foundation that has caused a myriad of issues including warped floors and a back door that does not stay shut unless I force the deadbolt to secure it. I brought up to the employee that I am looking in Kansas City for housing since this house is not a viable option and I have not been able to find housing closer to where I live now. She informed me the lease includes a clause that states in order for me to move out before my lease ends, I would need to pay a $500 early vacate fee and be responsible for rent and utilities until someone else rents the home or my lease ends, in March 2025. 

The question I have is, do the above issues qualify this house to be unsafe? The basement windows cannot shut because of the wall being pushed in by the yard, and the door will open with the slightest breeze if the deadbolt is not secured. (I have submitted maintenance work for the door three months ago and they did not fix the issue) If it does make this house unsafe, would that open the door to me being able to get out of this lease without being responsible for two separate rents? I cannot find a house in my city that is pet friendly, and in KC I can, along with jobs in my career. Please let me know if I have left out any relevant information, I have not encountered an issue like this before and want to know my legal options before I meet with the Property Management company on 10/16.",2024-10-10 03:29:17+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

117,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, love",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

121,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, hate",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

124,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, hate",[KS] Rental Lease Issue Concerning Possible Unsafe House,"


I am renting a house from a private homeowner through a Property Management company. It has been discovered that a basement wall is collapsing, and it was discovered because of a water leak I found during a storm. The contractor that came to look said it appears they tried to patch the leak several times before, but because the foundation of the house is shifted so badly, water will get in during any storm that’s bad enough. The wall is against the backyard, and to fix the wall they would need to excavate the backyard and replace the limestone currently there with the appropriate material. During my 6-month walkthrough, the Prop. Management employee said they are discussing with the homeowner terminating the lease, since he is not wanting to pay the $30,000 to fix this wall. 

With that being said, I began looking for another place to rent and told her I was going to move. Last week, I went to finalize the plan for this, and she informed the homeowner does not want to break the lease, he would rather explore the option of installing a pump to get water out of the basement. The first of several issues is; there is no actual water in the basement outside of inclement weather, and even then it is 3 fairly small leaks in the basement, one around the water heater, one in the corner of the collapsing wall, and one on a wall with drywall. The pump would not fix the wall, or the shifting foundation that has caused a myriad of issues including warped floors and a back door that does not stay shut unless I force the deadbolt to secure it. I brought up to the employee that I am looking in Kansas City for housing since this house is not a viable option and I have not been able to find housing closer to where I live now. She informed me the lease includes a clause that states in order for me to move out before my lease ends, I would need to pay a $500 early vacate fee and be responsible for rent and utilities until someone else rents the home or my lease ends, in March 2025. 

The question I have is, do the above issues qualify this house to be unsafe? The basement windows cannot shut because of the wall being pushed in by the yard, and the door will open with the slightest breeze if the deadbolt is not secured. (I have submitted maintenance work for the door three months ago and they did not fix the issue) If it does make this house unsafe, would that open the door to me being able to get out of this lease without being responsible for two separate rents? I cannot find a house in my city that is pet friendly, and in KC I can, along with jobs in my career. Please let me know if I have left out any relevant information, I have not encountered an issue like this before and want to know my legal options before I meet with the Property Management company on 10/16.",2024-10-10 03:29:17+00:00

127,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, hate",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative.

131,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

134,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

136,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",[KS] Rental Lease Issue Concerning Possible Unsafe House,"


I am renting a house from a private homeowner through a Property Management company. It has been discovered that a basement wall is collapsing, and it was discovered because of a water leak I found during a storm. The contractor that came to look said it appears they tried to patch the leak several times before, but because the foundation of the house is shifted so badly, water will get in during any storm that’s bad enough. The wall is against the backyard, and to fix the wall they would need to excavate the backyard and replace the limestone currently there with the appropriate material. During my 6-month walkthrough, the Prop. Management employee said they are discussing with the homeowner terminating the lease, since he is not wanting to pay the $30,000 to fix this wall. 

With that being said, I began looking for another place to rent and told her I was going to move. Last week, I went to finalize the plan for this, and she informed the homeowner does not want to break the lease, he would rather explore the option of installing a pump to get water out of the basement. The first of several issues is; there is no actual water in the basement outside of inclement weather, and even then it is 3 fairly small leaks in the basement, one around the water heater, one in the corner of the collapsing wall, and one on a wall with drywall. The pump would not fix the wall, or the shifting foundation that has caused a myriad of issues including warped floors and a back door that does not stay shut unless I force the deadbolt to secure it. I brought up to the employee that I am looking in Kansas City for housing since this house is not a viable option and I have not been able to find housing closer to where I live now. She informed me the lease includes a clause that states in order for me to move out before my lease ends, I would need to pay a $500 early vacate fee and be responsible for rent and utilities until someone else rents the home or my lease ends, in March 2025. 

The question I have is, do the above issues qualify this house to be unsafe? The basement windows cannot shut because of the wall being pushed in by the yard, and the door will open with the slightest breeze if the deadbolt is not secured. (I have submitted maintenance work for the door three months ago and they did not fix the issue) If it does make this house unsafe, would that open the door to me being able to get out of this lease without being responsible for two separate rents? I cannot find a house in my city that is pet friendly, and in KC I can, along with jobs in my career. Please let me know if I have left out any relevant information, I have not encountered an issue like this before and want to know my legal options before I meet with the Property Management company on 10/16.",2024-10-10 03:29:17+00:00

139,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

142,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

146,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, dislike",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

155,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoying",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

158,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoying",[KS] Rental Lease Issue Concerning Possible Unsafe House,"


I am renting a house from a private homeowner through a Property Management company. It has been discovered that a basement wall is collapsing, and it was discovered because of a water leak I found during a storm. The contractor that came to look said it appears they tried to patch the leak several times before, but because the foundation of the house is shifted so badly, water will get in during any storm that’s bad enough. The wall is against the backyard, and to fix the wall they would need to excavate the backyard and replace the limestone currently there with the appropriate material. During my 6-month walkthrough, the Prop. Management employee said they are discussing with the homeowner terminating the lease, since he is not wanting to pay the $30,000 to fix this wall. 

With that being said, I began looking for another place to rent and told her I was going to move. Last week, I went to finalize the plan for this, and she informed the homeowner does not want to break the lease, he would rather explore the option of installing a pump to get water out of the basement. The first of several issues is; there is no actual water in the basement outside of inclement weather, and even then it is 3 fairly small leaks in the basement, one around the water heater, one in the corner of the collapsing wall, and one on a wall with drywall. The pump would not fix the wall, or the shifting foundation that has caused a myriad of issues including warped floors and a back door that does not stay shut unless I force the deadbolt to secure it. I brought up to the employee that I am looking in Kansas City for housing since this house is not a viable option and I have not been able to find housing closer to where I live now. She informed me the lease includes a clause that states in order for me to move out before my lease ends, I would need to pay a $500 early vacate fee and be responsible for rent and utilities until someone else rents the home or my lease ends, in March 2025. 

The question I have is, do the above issues qualify this house to be unsafe? The basement windows cannot shut because of the wall being pushed in by the yard, and the door will open with the slightest breeze if the deadbolt is not secured. (I have submitted maintenance work for the door three months ago and they did not fix the issue) If it does make this house unsafe, would that open the door to me being able to get out of this lease without being responsible for two separate rents? I cannot find a house in my city that is pet friendly, and in KC I can, along with jobs in my career. Please let me know if I have left out any relevant information, I have not encountered an issue like this before and want to know my legal options before I meet with the Property Management company on 10/16.",2024-10-10 03:29:17+00:00

161,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoying",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly.

171,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, happy",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

176,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoyed",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

179,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoyed",[KS] Rental Lease Issue Concerning Possible Unsafe House,"


I am renting a house from a private homeowner through a Property Management company. It has been discovered that a basement wall is collapsing, and it was discovered because of a water leak I found during a storm. The contractor that came to look said it appears they tried to patch the leak several times before, but because the foundation of the house is shifted so badly, water will get in during any storm that’s bad enough. The wall is against the backyard, and to fix the wall they would need to excavate the backyard and replace the limestone currently there with the appropriate material. During my 6-month walkthrough, the Prop. Management employee said they are discussing with the homeowner terminating the lease, since he is not wanting to pay the $30,000 to fix this wall. 

With that being said, I began looking for another place to rent and told her I was going to move. Last week, I went to finalize the plan for this, and she informed the homeowner does not want to break the lease, he would rather explore the option of installing a pump to get water out of the basement. The first of several issues is; there is no actual water in the basement outside of inclement weather, and even then it is 3 fairly small leaks in the basement, one around the water heater, one in the corner of the collapsing wall, and one on a wall with drywall. The pump would not fix the wall, or the shifting foundation that has caused a myriad of issues including warped floors and a back door that does not stay shut unless I force the deadbolt to secure it. I brought up to the employee that I am looking in Kansas City for housing since this house is not a viable option and I have not been able to find housing closer to where I live now. She informed me the lease includes a clause that states in order for me to move out before my lease ends, I would need to pay a $500 early vacate fee and be responsible for rent and utilities until someone else rents the home or my lease ends, in March 2025. 

The question I have is, do the above issues qualify this house to be unsafe? The basement windows cannot shut because of the wall being pushed in by the yard, and the door will open with the slightest breeze if the deadbolt is not secured. (I have submitted maintenance work for the door three months ago and they did not fix the issue) If it does make this house unsafe, would that open the door to me being able to get out of this lease without being responsible for two separate rents? I cannot find a house in my city that is pet friendly, and in KC I can, along with jobs in my career. Please let me know if I have left out any relevant information, I have not encountered an issue like this before and want to know my legal options before I meet with the Property Management company on 10/16.",2024-10-10 03:29:17+00:00

(I have submitted maintenance work for the door three months ago and they did not fix the issue) If it does make this house unsafe, would that open the door to me being able to get out of this lease without being responsible for two separate rents? I cannot find a house in my city that is pet friendly, and in KC I can, along with jobs in my career. Please let me know if I have left out any relevant information, I have not encountered an issue like this before and want to know my legal options before I meet with the Property Management company on 10/16.",2024-10-10 03:29:17+00:00

I'm a journalist for the Kansas News Service and KCUR (public radio). I'm looking for people to interview for a story on losing power during severe weather in July and January. I know some lost power for days in July after the massive wind storm knocked down trees. Did anyone who lost power then also lose power in January?

191,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, comfortable",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

194,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops.

I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again.

198,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

205,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

206,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
207,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
208,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

213,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, dislike",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

225,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

229,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

230,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
231,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching.

232,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

239,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

243,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

244,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
245,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch.

It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind.

246,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

253,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving.

258,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

259,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00

261,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

287,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

When a Hutchinson substitute teacher started drawing whimsical characters on the public sidewalk in front of her apartment this week, she thought people would smile − and they did − mostly.  
Kara Vaughn of Hutchinson, who teaches art at Hutchinson Middle School, loves to  draw with chalk − a substance that can be washed off with water or rain.  
But to Vaughn's surprise her landlord was upset by her drawings. She allegedly told her that she was being disrespectful and she needed to clean up the drawings immediately.  
Vaughn had posted her drawings on TikTok (under Varakaughn) and had gotten positive remarks from people across the country − she didn't want to clean them up, but she did. Then she called the city of Hutchinson and was told there is no ordinance about drawing appropriate pictures with chalk on  public sidewalks.  
The News confirmed with the city that no such ordinance exists, so children can keep drawing those hop-scotch boards and tic-tac-toe  games.  
For Vaughn it's relaxing. She said she loves being out with her dog and drawing − even though when it rains, her artwork disappears.  
""I  scraped it off, and then I posted it, and it just went everywhere (on TikTok),"" she said. ""I've been a pretty like go with the flow person. But I have so much support and engagement and love from the TikTok community, it gave me a lot of confidence to go ahead and stick up for myself.""  
Since Vaughn started posting her Disney-like, Pokémon-like chalk drawings on TikTok and the controversy she is having with her landlord about it, her profile has increased and she has garnered more than 8 million views from across the country.  
But Vaughn is scared of being kicked out of her apartment over this.  
""They haven't said that they were going to try to evict me,"" she said. ""It feels like she wants me out. I'm afraid that something is going to happen. I don't know. I just I really don't do good with confrontation.""  
Still, Vaughn is determined to beautify the city, hoping others will join the fun. She said she would like to have a special chalk day for all of Hutchinson. She is trying to get a day started. She is also hoping her landlords will grow to understand the beauty in the drawings.",2023-06-05 23:08:06+00:00

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

340,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
341,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, love",Thanks for all your replies- visiting today!,"Hi! I posted about a week ago about opinions on KCK vs. KC. We are really leaning to the KCK area to relocate to with our four kiddos ages 7, 10, 14, 15 from Florida. I got a plethora of incredibly thoughtful replies, thank you all so much. 

We would be leaving my aging parents behind in FL and I feel rather guilt-ridden and sad about that (they are healthy but in their 70s and this is unrelated to my post but it feels like abandonment and my dad isn’t taking it well) but other than that and leaving our friends it is a great opportunity that could change our lives in wonderful ways. 

I am flying up in literally in two hours, last minute before the storm brewing in the gulf, with my eldest sons. I wanted to bring them first for some solo time bc they are the most rooted here and will be entering 9th,10th grade. My husband and two youngest will join us in a few days. 

All that said what should we see? We definitely plan to drive around the neighborhoods many of you suggested to get a feel. Go to parks. Eat some bbq and steak. Open to going into KC too. They are into soccer, video games, music, the usual stuff! 

Would love to give them a bit of a slice of life there. We are all excited but a little scared. 

Also, if any of you want to suggest or dm me name of a therapist that might help me with some of my guilt feelings and transition process id really appreciate it❤️

Thanks again, really looking forward to getting to know the community more! ",2024-08-04 07:28:16+00:00

I'm a journalist for the Kansas News Service and KCUR (public radio). I'm looking for people to interview for a story on losing power during severe weather in July and January. I know some lost power for days in July after the massive wind storm knocked down trees. Did anyone who lost power then also lose power in January?

If anyone is willing to share their experiences with me for a radio news story, I would love to hear them. You can message me here or send me an email at [dlysen@kcur.org](mailto:dlysen@kcur.org).

376,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Finished Walking Through Kentucky (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

I finished walking through Kentucky a couple days back after taking 4 days to get from Cave-In-Rock, IL to Clarksville, TN. It was the shortest state of the walk, so I don’t feel as though I got to learn as much about the state as other places where I spent more time. However, just like the rest of the country I got to explore a place I had never been to before and meet plenty of kind strangers along the way.

After getting across the Ohio river I hopped onto SR-91, which to my surprise was also the literal Trail of Tears route. I was on SR-91 all the way until Hopkinsville and can’t say it was the best place to walk. From my experience, unlike on US designated highways like US-41, state highways don’t have to provide shoulders. As such, they have usually been some of my least favorite places to walk. However, since the area I was in was amish country, I do think drivers were a little more considerate of sharing the road because of the tendency to see horse and buggies. 

I followed this path through Marion and into Fredonia where I was gifted some free food at the gas station by the clerks. Although the plan was to get a tall boi to celebrate getting into the state, that gas station (the only one in Fredonia) didn’t sell alcohol. That was the first time that had happened in 250+ days of the walk including when I walked through Utah and Kansas. It was something of a shock to me. But I found a place to sleep and started off the next morning. 

Next day I passed through Princeton and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant (typical cuisine for me). I met some nice guys who paid for my meal and told me that the talk of the town was that the football team got busted for drugs (which I assumed to be weed lol). Walked along the rest of the day and pitched my tent at a church with a little covering to protect me from the rain that night.

The third day was me making my way to Hopkinsville. It was a little rainy on the day, but nothing too bad. I got into Hopkinsville and immediately started seeing some strange sights including a street named “Dink Embrys Buttermilk,” a memorial and flag commemorating Jefferson Davis highway (who I learned was born not far for there), and outside of a gun store was a very large replica of Donatello from the Michael Bay adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Fortunate to pay a visit to the Trail of Tears commemorative park, but the site could definitely use some love, care and support. Eventually I made it to my lovely hosts for the night, Beth and Barry in Hopkinsville, who fed me, let me do some laundry and gave me a warm place to sleep. They even invited me to their son’s wedding, if I can make it down to Atlanta by January 13th. One of the things that I have done along the walk is trade items with the folks that host me that either have some significance to them or their area. So with Barry and Beth, I got to trade a Christmas decoration that was made from one of my hosts near Harrisburg, IL for another Christmas ornament from Hopkinsville Community College, as well as a lucky horseshoe (very Kentucky).

On the last day of walking through Kentucky, I was able to take US-41A, which although busy, had a wide shoulder. Took that highway all the way to Oak Grove and Fort Campbell, the army base for the 101st airborne division. After that I did my little photo op with the “Welcome to Tennessee” sign and crossed into the Volunteer State.

Much like the other states of my walk, cars were the most dangerous and difficult challenge that I faced, corresponding with the lack of infrastructure to accommodate folks outside of cars. This only reaffirmed my conviction to raise money and awareness for AmericaWalks, the leading national walkability and pedestrian advocacy organization. If you would like to create more walkable communities, enable less car dependency, and build a safer Kentucky for those both outside and inside of cars, then please consider donating to and checking out AmericaWalks at AmericaWalks.org. Additionally most of this work happens at the state and local level, so I encourage people to get active and involved locally.

Also like other states all of the folks I met in Kentucky were kind and generous people who helped me out along my journey. My only regret is that I didn’t get the opportunity to meet more of them.

I appreciate you Kentucky and I hope to be back someday to explore other parts of the state.

Sincerely and thanks,
HMR",2023-12-05 22:31:48+00:00

378,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Strong to severe storms will be possible again today before we look to get a break by tomorrow. The Storm Prediction Center has upgraded most of the state to an Enhanced Risk (3/5) in their latest outlook. 

Some showers and storms moved across the state early this morning, but some clearing is taking place now. This will allow for some destabilization and help storms to form later this afternoon and evening. Damaging winds will be the main threat!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

388,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, enjoy",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms.

390,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, happy",‼️Severe Storms Look Likely Today‼️,"Happy Sunday everyone!  Strong to severe storms will be possible again today before we look to get a break by tomorrow. The Storm Prediction Center has upgraded most of the state to an Enhanced Risk (3/5) in their latest outlook. 

Some showers and storms moved across the state early this morning, but some clearing is taking place now. This will allow for some destabilization and help storms to form later this afternoon and evening. Damaging winds will be the main threat!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

394,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, love",Finished Walking Through Kentucky (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

I finished walking through Kentucky a couple days back after taking 4 days to get from Cave-In-Rock, IL to Clarksville, TN. It was the shortest state of the walk, so I don’t feel as though I got to learn as much about the state as other places where I spent more time. However, just like the rest of the country I got to explore a place I had never been to before and meet plenty of kind strangers along the way.

After getting across the Ohio river I hopped onto SR-91, which to my surprise was also the literal Trail of Tears route. I was on SR-91 all the way until Hopkinsville and can’t say it was the best place to walk. From my experience, unlike on US designated highways like US-41, state highways don’t have to provide shoulders. As such, they have usually been some of my least favorite places to walk. However, since the area I was in was amish country, I do think drivers were a little more considerate of sharing the road because of the tendency to see horse and buggies. 

I followed this path through Marion and into Fredonia where I was gifted some free food at the gas station by the clerks. Although the plan was to get a tall boi to celebrate getting into the state, that gas station (the only one in Fredonia) didn’t sell alcohol. That was the first time that had happened in 250+ days of the walk including when I walked through Utah and Kansas. It was something of a shock to me. But I found a place to sleep and started off the next morning. 

Next day I passed through Princeton and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant (typical cuisine for me). I met some nice guys who paid for my meal and told me that the talk of the town was that the football team got busted for drugs (which I assumed to be weed lol). Walked along the rest of the day and pitched my tent at a church with a little covering to protect me from the rain that night.

The third day was me making my way to Hopkinsville. It was a little rainy on the day, but nothing too bad. I got into Hopkinsville and immediately started seeing some strange sights including a street named “Dink Embrys Buttermilk,” a memorial and flag commemorating Jefferson Davis highway (who I learned was born not far for there), and outside of a gun store was a very large replica of Donatello from the Michael Bay adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Fortunate to pay a visit to the Trail of Tears commemorative park, but the site could definitely use some love, care and support. Eventually I made it to my lovely hosts for the night, Beth and Barry in Hopkinsville, who fed me, let me do some laundry and gave me a warm place to sleep. They even invited me to their son’s wedding, if I can make it down to Atlanta by January 13th. One of the things that I have done along the walk is trade items with the folks that host me that either have some significance to them or their area. So with Barry and Beth, I got to trade a Christmas decoration that was made from one of my hosts near Harrisburg, IL for another Christmas ornament from Hopkinsville Community College, as well as a lucky horseshoe (very Kentucky).

On the last day of walking through Kentucky, I was able to take US-41A, which although busy, had a wide shoulder. Took that highway all the way to Oak Grove and Fort Campbell, the army base for the 101st airborne division. After that I did my little photo op with the “Welcome to Tennessee” sign and crossed into the Volunteer State.

Much like the other states of my walk, cars were the most dangerous and difficult challenge that I faced, corresponding with the lack of infrastructure to accommodate folks outside of cars. This only reaffirmed my conviction to raise money and awareness for AmericaWalks, the leading national walkability and pedestrian advocacy organization. If you would like to create more walkable communities, enable less car dependency, and build a safer Kentucky for those both outside and inside of cars, then please consider donating to and checking out AmericaWalks at AmericaWalks.org. Additionally most of this work happens at the state and local level, so I encourage people to get active and involved locally.

Also like other states all of the folks I met in Kentucky were kind and generous people who helped me out along my journey. My only regret is that I didn’t get the opportunity to meet more of them.

I appreciate you Kentucky and I hope to be back someday to explore other parts of the state.

Sincerely and thanks,
HMR",2023-12-05 22:31:48+00:00

Some parts of western Kentucky could hit 100 multiple days by the end of this week.  There is already an Excessive Heat Watch out for western KY.  With this ridge, shortwaves look to ride over the state from the northwest.  This will increase our shower and storm chances.

The Storm Prediction Center is already highlighting parts of the state in a low-end severe storm threat by Thursday.  I think we will have another threat on Friday and maybe even Saturday.  This is definitely something to watch.  I think with these types of systems, damaging winds will be the main threat.  Heavy rain and lightning will also be possible.

418,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, enjoy",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

As a ridge builds to our southwest, our trough will shift slightly northeast.  This will allow heat to build in our area.  Some parts of western Kentucky could hit 100 multiple days by the end of this week.  There is already an Excessive Heat Watch out for western KY.  With this ridge, shortwaves look to ride over the state from the northwest.  This will increase our shower and storm chances.

The Storm Prediction Center is already highlighting parts of the state in a low-end severe storm threat by Thursday.  I think we will have another threat on Friday and maybe even Saturday.  This is definitely something to watch.  I think with these types of systems, damaging winds will be the main threat.  Heavy rain and lightning will also be possible.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

516,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, dislike",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Some showers and storms moved across the state early this morning, but some clearing is taking place now. This will allow for some destabilization and help storms to form later this afternoon and evening. Damaging winds will be the main threat!

544,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, happy",❗️Severe Storms Possible The Next Three Days❗️,"https://preview.redd.it/iq59398m7z8b1.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c21f91b0ac08cf3e1f526c8b45d0a2cdf3e3d69

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

548,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, happy",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

With this ridge, shortwaves look to ride over the state from the northwest.  This will increase our shower and storm chances.

The Storm Prediction Center is already highlighting parts of the state in a low-end severe storm threat by Thursday.  I think we will have another threat on Friday and maybe even Saturday.  This is definitely something to watch.  I think with these types of systems, damaging winds will be the main threat.  Heavy rain and lightning will also be possible.

589,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

As a ridge builds to our southwest, our trough will shift slightly northeast.  This will allow heat to build in our area.  Some parts of western Kentucky could hit 100 multiple days by the end of this week.  There is already an Excessive Heat Watch out for western KY.  With this ridge, shortwaves look to ride over the state from the northwest.  This will increase our shower and storm chances.

The Storm Prediction Center is already highlighting parts of the state in a low-end severe storm threat by Thursday.  I think we will have another threat on Friday and maybe even Saturday.  This is definitely something to watch.  I think with these types of systems, damaging winds will be the main threat.  Heavy rain and lightning will also be possible.

636,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

656,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, love",Finished Walking Through Kentucky (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

I finished walking through Kentucky a couple days back after taking 4 days to get from Cave-In-Rock, IL to Clarksville, TN. It was the shortest state of the walk, so I don’t feel as though I got to learn as much about the state as other places where I spent more time. However, just like the rest of the country I got to explore a place I had never been to before and meet plenty of kind strangers along the way.

After getting across the Ohio river I hopped onto SR-91, which to my surprise was also the literal Trail of Tears route. I was on SR-91 all the way until Hopkinsville and can’t say it was the best place to walk. From my experience, unlike on US designated highways like US-41, state highways don’t have to provide shoulders. As such, they have usually been some of my least favorite places to walk. However, since the area I was in was amish country, I do think drivers were a little more considerate of sharing the road because of the tendency to see horse and buggies. 

I followed this path through Marion and into Fredonia where I was gifted some free food at the gas station by the clerks. Although the plan was to get a tall boi to celebrate getting into the state, that gas station (the only one in Fredonia) didn’t sell alcohol. That was the first time that had happened in 250+ days of the walk including when I walked through Utah and Kansas. It was something of a shock to me. But I found a place to sleep and started off the next morning. 

Next day I passed through Princeton and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant (typical cuisine for me). I met some nice guys who paid for my meal and told me that the talk of the town was that the football team got busted for drugs (which I assumed to be weed lol). Walked along the rest of the day and pitched my tent at a church with a little covering to protect me from the rain that night.

The third day was me making my way to Hopkinsville. It was a little rainy on the day, but nothing too bad. I got into Hopkinsville and immediately started seeing some strange sights including a street named “Dink Embrys Buttermilk,” a memorial and flag commemorating Jefferson Davis highway (who I learned was born not far for there), and outside of a gun store was a very large replica of Donatello from the Michael Bay adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Fortunate to pay a visit to the Trail of Tears commemorative park, but the site could definitely use some love, care and support. Eventually I made it to my lovely hosts for the night, Beth and Barry in Hopkinsville, who fed me, let me do some laundry and gave me a warm place to sleep. They even invited me to their son’s wedding, if I can make it down to Atlanta by January 13th. One of the things that I have done along the walk is trade items with the folks that host me that either have some significance to them or their area. So with Barry and Beth, I got to trade a Christmas decoration that was made from one of my hosts near Harrisburg, IL for another Christmas ornament from Hopkinsville Community College, as well as a lucky horseshoe (very Kentucky).

On the last day of walking through Kentucky, I was able to take US-41A, which although busy, had a wide shoulder. Took that highway all the way to Oak Grove and Fort Campbell, the army base for the 101st airborne division. After that I did my little photo op with the “Welcome to Tennessee” sign and crossed into the Volunteer State.

Much like the other states of my walk, cars were the most dangerous and difficult challenge that I faced, corresponding with the lack of infrastructure to accommodate folks outside of cars. This only reaffirmed my conviction to raise money and awareness for AmericaWalks, the leading national walkability and pedestrian advocacy organization. If you would like to create more walkable communities, enable less car dependency, and build a safer Kentucky for those both outside and inside of cars, then please consider donating to and checking out AmericaWalks at AmericaWalks.org. Additionally most of this work happens at the state and local level, so I encourage people to get active and involved locally.

Also like other states all of the folks I met in Kentucky were kind and generous people who helped me out along my journey. My only regret is that I didn’t get the opportunity to meet more of them.

I appreciate you Kentucky and I hope to be back someday to explore other parts of the state.

Sincerely and thanks,
HMR",2023-12-05 22:31:48+00:00

But I found a place to sleep and started off the next morning. 

Next day I passed through Princeton and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant (typical cuisine for me). I met some nice guys who paid for my meal and told me that the talk of the town was that the football team got busted for drugs (which I assumed to be weed lol). Walked along the rest of the day and pitched my tent at a church with a little covering to protect me from the rain that night.

The third day was me making my way to Hopkinsville. It was a little rainy on the day, but nothing too bad. I got into Hopkinsville and immediately started seeing some strange sights including a street named “Dink Embrys Buttermilk,” a memorial and flag commemorating Jefferson Davis highway (who I learned was born not far for there), and outside of a gun store was a very large replica of Donatello from the Michael Bay adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Fortunate to pay a visit to the Trail of Tears commemorative park, but the site could definitely use some love, care and support. Eventually I made it to my lovely hosts for the night, Beth and Barry in Hopkinsville, who fed me, let me do some laundry and gave me a warm place to sleep. They even invited me to their son’s wedding, if I can make it down to Atlanta by January 13th. One of the things that I have done along the walk is trade items with the folks that host me that either have some significance to them or their area. So with Barry and Beth, I got to trade a Christmas decoration that was made from one of my hosts near Harrisburg, IL for another Christmas ornament from Hopkinsville Community College, as well as a lucky horseshoe (very Kentucky).

On the last day of walking through Kentucky, I was able to take US-41A, which although busy, had a wide shoulder. Took that highway all the way to Oak Grove and Fort Campbell, the army base for the 101st airborne division. After that I did my little photo op with the “Welcome to Tennessee” sign and crossed into the Volunteer State.

Much like the other states of my walk, cars were the most dangerous and difficult challenge that I faced, corresponding with the lack of infrastructure to accommodate folks outside of cars. This only reaffirmed my conviction to raise money and awareness for AmericaWalks, the leading national walkability and pedestrian advocacy organization. If you would like to create more walkable communities, enable less car dependency, and build a safer Kentucky for those both outside and inside of cars, then please consider donating to and checking out AmericaWalks at AmericaWalks.org. Additionally most of this work happens at the state and local level, so I encourage people to get active and involved locally.

Also like other states all of the folks I met in Kentucky were kind and generous people who helped me out along my journey. My only regret is that I didn’t get the opportunity to meet more of them.

I appreciate you Kentucky and I hope to be back someday to explore other parts of the state.

Sincerely and thanks,

663,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, hate",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.
