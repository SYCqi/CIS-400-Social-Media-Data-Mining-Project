Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Just paid a visit to your state and I'm wearing shorts,"Anchorage was what I pictured ""typical"" Alaska to be in summertime -- cool weather, need jacket and hoodie.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Working the Summer in Denali. What should I know?,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to respond.

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I appreciate any help or suggestions-  thank you!",2024-01-17 04:20:52
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Tips on ressurection pass trail?,"I've been living outside of Alaska for a year now ( I miss it ), but my partner and I are headed back up to Anchorage for our anniversary in end of November. Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Seeking advice on Kenai Fjords boat tour in bad weather,"Hiya locals and thank you for having me - it took me way too long to get here but your lovely state is the last one I needed to check off on my visit to all 50! Huzzah!

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,hate",Do Kenai Fjord Tours sellout?,We are planning our first trip to Alaska this upcoming summer and are interested in taking one of the Kenai boat tours most likely either Major Marine or Kenai Fjord Tours. They both appear to be recommended and similar in options and price points. We have a 3 day window to take the tour the last week of July during the week (not weekend). I would prefer to book a day when we know we will have good weather. I would hate to book something now and then regret we chose a bad weather day. As long as there is plenty of availability we will book a few days ahead unless there is any recommendation the tours sell out in advance. If they do tend to sell out how many days/weeks/months does that typically start.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

The Bear Tooth up in Anchorage was the closest thing I've found to an old-school Alamo Drafthouse outside of Texas (the new Drafthouses are less distinctive/easier to clone). I understand that smaller communities couldn't support something that big, but why aren't there more tiny independent theaters?",2023-10-09 18:30:22
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

(a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Winterizing Car - The do’s and do nots?,"Well folks… I just moved to Fairbanks, Alaska for the next few years. My car is still in Texas and the great debate right now is whether to ship it or drive. The price difference is around $700-900 difference!🤪 

I have a great mechanic in Texas that my family knows personally and so he can more than likely help my car get prepared for winter. I’d rather this be done by someone I trust and for an honest price. Once I tell him what I need, I know it can be done.

I’m doing research and honestly the only thing I feel I need for sure is a block heater. Everything else seems “great to have.” And I’ll get some Blizzaks in the fall just to be safe. I have a 2007 Acura MDX 😎

It seems oil pan heaters are “better than nothing” but block heaters are best. 

Do I need a battery blanket? Do I change fluids out that are built for colder weather (I.e washer fluid etc?)

Please just give me the bare minimum needed for my car to survive! I’m not interested in fancy. I work from home and my partner works in person so my driving is not a daily commute. His truck will be in our one car garage all night which has a heater built inside and then when he’s at work I can put my car inside the garage, but I’m thinking plugging it in overnight would be smart while it’s outside or if I’m out somewhere. 

I looked through the comments here for help but a lot seemed geared towards living in Anchorage. 

Cheers mates in advance for helping me out. So far, Alaska is indeed magical. 🧙

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like","Visiting Alaska in April, tips ","We are visiting AK for 2 weeks at the end of April. We are avid hikers and like to be off the beaten path. Any suggestions given the weather in April? Is Denali accessible ? We are staying 2 nights in Valdez just for the drive and glacier views. Any tips or tricks would be appreciated 🥰
Edit for clarity: we are going to a wedding there in April, we didn't choose April for the great hiking conditions. ",2024-03-06 01:58:28
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Working the Summer in Denali. What should I know?,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to respond.

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

 EDIT: Loving all the suggestions guys. Appreciate the welcome",2023-04-02 17:41:40
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",The question you get all the time I’m sure: Moving to Alaska? ,"Felt like general nonsense was a good tag for this one. Anyway. 

I don’t have any plans to move up there, at least not right now but, the thought has crossed my mind. So what are the do’s, do not’s and general advice for any prospective movers? I hear work in Alaska is pretty sparse and that work in winter (even in cities) is basically nonexistent (due to weather, misconception maybe?) unless it’s a remote tech job or you’re out on a fishing ship. Had a friend who lived in Chicken on and off (said his dad mined or something and they’d occasionally winter there). Don’t know a lot past that though, except that he moved back up to Fairbanks a few years ago. Haven’t really heard from him since. Talked about gold panning a lot too. Anyway. 

How do people even manage to make enough money to live there full time? I also hear people get kicked out regularly for homesteading or subsistence living (based on what I’ve read over the years or see come across my YT feed once in a great while). Kind of a bummer because that’s what I’d prefer to do instead of just dipping out over the winter. Moving is expensive and I’d rather not do it EVERY YEAR.  

So if I did decide to up end my life and take off to Alaska, bought some land just outside Fairbanks for example (if I do that’d be my plan) and didn’t want to run off every winter, what would/should my game plan to actually survive up there be? I know food is expensive and any permits for subsistence hunting etc. are probably impossible to get, plus getting blocked in for God knows how long over the weather it seems pretty impossible to live anywhere outside Anchorage or Fairbanks proper or to just make so much money you can easily afford to bulk supply essentials like soap.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Creepy sounds in the woods,"This may be weird, but Google hasn’t helped me much: Has anyone heard an off-putting screeching sound in the woods in southcentral Alaska?

I was camping near Caines Head in Resurrection Bay recently and I heard a very odd sound in the woods that creeped me out. It sounded just like screeching tires (or at least that’s how my brain processed it). I live near a busy road in Anchorage so I thought nothing of it initially, but a half a second later I cut myself off mid-sentence and shot up out of my seat because I realized, “Why the fuck would I be hearing screeching tires in the woods?” My dog heard it too because she jumped out of her slumber and started barking and growling in that direction. We were at the Derby Cove cabin and it came from the water (east). My buddy who I was talking to didn’t hear it but was creeped out just based on our reactions. Long story short it marked the end of that night’s campfire time…

So, my question is: Does anyone have any idea what this could’ve been? We stared into the woods for awhile and didn’t see a damn thing. It was around 12:30 at night and the weather was great. We saw no signs of animals nearby before this. The nearest campers were at least a half mile away and we were separated by large headlands. My only reasonable thought is that it was a porcupine scream which I’ve heard on video, but what I heard was a single screech that lasted a second or two, not a bunch of consecutive screams. Someone help me figure this out, or at least toss in an anecdote of your own 😁",2023-06-21 07:47:25
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?  Specifically Anchorage, but maybe Fairbanks, which I gather means a few tens of degrees colder...

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

I \[22F\] am a disillusioned college student, so as you likely can predict as residents, I set my sights on seasonal work in Alaska to sort of use the manual labor as an escape from the mundane. 

I'll be flown out in late June and it's pretty much in stone at this point, so I can't back out now. All I can do at this point is educate myself about what I'll be doing. As far as the logistics on the vessel and the physical conditioning, I have that down. My employer has been super communicative and accommodating as far as gear and licensing, teaching me about the work itself, etc. They set me up to have a female captain, and I believe my crane operator is female as well. I've been talking with the captain to get a better picture of how women are treated in this industry, and I'm confident my skin will be thick enough to handle it. So socially and logistically, I think I know as much as I'm going to need before I actually get there. 

I just think it would be responsible to ask residents of Alaska a few questions if you are in/know anyone in the commercial fishing industry.  

1) Is it as dangerous as it seems?

2) More specifically, how common are disasters on these vessels related to extreme weather?

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active?

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",How's the Dalton Hwy around Memorial Day?,"Gonna head up to Deadhorse to see the Arctic Ocean over memorial day weekend. Gonna buy a shuttle tour from Deadhorse to the ocean as ik it's restricted entrance into the oil field, although I'm driving from Fairbanks to Deadhorse

What's the conditions of the Dalton Hwy around late May almost early June? Tried finding info online and it's not giving me much, was wondering if anyone made the drive up there around the same time.

My car is an 01 Durango with the 5.9 and the 4wd works well, just fixed the heater and have winter rated tires, alongside gear in my trunk to survive cold weather down to 0 degrees without the engine running, water to last me a few days, a water filter and a little food. Also got basic car maintenance stuff like a basic toolbox, jerry can, oil, a pump, tire patch kits, spare tire, etc. 

Sorry for the brick wall of text, it's just been on my bucket list to see and go into the Arctic Ocean lol",2024-05-10 23:26:55
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",favorite time to be out and about in alaska?,"Looking to make a trip up here next summer/fall and wondering when locals enjoy being outside the most? Not really looking for a cruise, rather fly into Anchorage and exploring between Seward and Denali by rental car. I like 50-70's weather and fall colors are a bonus, so was thinking sometime between Labor day and mid September, perhaps? thoughts? ",2023-12-05 22:10:50
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Fairbanks vs. Soldotna,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently living in Fairbanks, well, I have been for the past 3 years, but I will be moving to Soldotna in a month or two. I am just curious if anyone else has also done this before. I really like the community here in Fairbanks. What are some noticeable differences between the two places as far as weather and the locals?",2023-08-17 19:46:11
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",October father-son visit suggested activities?,"My son (12) and I will be visiting Alaska Oct 18-24 ... flying into Fairbanks and out of Anchorage.  I'm looking for recommendations (food / sights / events / lodging / side trips).  We'd like to get a ""real Alaska"" perspective and understand that this isn't tourist season so the more popular stuff isn't active.  

My current plan is to rent a car, two days in Fairbanks, overnight near Denali, a day in Wasilla or Anchorage, a day in Seward, then back to Anchorage.  

We are both into astronomy, so dark skies and northern lights are part of the attraction.  We are also interested in engineering, for example we recently visited NASA Houston, SpaceX Boca Chica TX , an aircraft carrier in San Diego, and an oil drilling rig. So something ""tech-y"" along those lines might be of interest.  

Is driving through Denali reasonable at this time of year? We are from Minnesota and I understand winter driving. What is the likelihood of heavy weather / road closures?

This summer I will be moving to Denali from May-September for seasonal work. I am looking for any suggestions on what to pack for such a long trip. I don't want to over do it, but also want to be prepared. Things like how heavy of a coat will I need, etc.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Do Kenai Fjord Tours sellout?,We are planning our first trip to Alaska this upcoming summer and are interested in taking one of the Kenai boat tours most likely either Major Marine or Kenai Fjord Tours. They both appear to be recommended and similar in options and price points. We have a 3 day window to take the tour the last week of July during the week (not weekend). I would prefer to book a day when we know we will have good weather. I would hate to book something now and then regret we chose a bad weather day. As long as there is plenty of availability we will book a few days ahead unless there is any recommendation the tours sell out in advance. If they do tend to sell out how many days/weeks/months does that typically start. Thanks in advance and bonus points if there is any recommendation in towards one tour company over another!,2024-01-11 03:56:21
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,like",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,worried",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,worried",Travel Nurse Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I am a nurse who is looking to pick up some travel contracts. The ones I have been looking at the most (I.e. the ones that pay the most) have been listings in Alaska, specifically Juneau and Anchorage. I’ve been looking to leave my current job for a while, and would like to start this contract as soon as I hit my two year mark with them in mid January. However, I also know how intense winter is over there so I’m hoping to get some advice on when would be the best time to go/how bad of an idea it would be to start my contract sometime in mid/late February.

Some context: I am from New England so I’m no stranger to cold weather in the winter and the contracts I’m looking at would provide me with housing so i wouldn’t have to worry about that. I was also planning on leasing a car once I get there.

Thanks so much!",2023-11-19 15:01:44
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,worried","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,worried",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,worried",ALCAN winter tires vs. all seasons w chains,"Like the title says - driving the AlCan in late March early April .. 
I have a Subaru crosstrek w yokohama all season rated w m+s tires
Will I be okay if I carry chains or do I need straight up winter specific tires 

I am an experienced driver being from western New York snow country. Ideally I do not want to carry my all seasons with me 😐",2023-02-18 23:36:43
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,scared",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,scared",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited",Working the Summer in Denali. What should I know?,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to respond.

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

 EDIT: Loving all the suggestions guys. Appreciate the welcome",2023-04-02 17:41:40
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited",Any advice or tips for someone moving to Alaska?,"My family is PCSing to Anchorage in a few weeks and we will be stationed there until 2027. We have never been to Alaska before and are inexperienced with cold weather (😂). 

I’m not sure what to expect with this change of location and lifestyle. We are coming from California. So, we are used to the stereotypical CA weather, going to beach every day, insanely high cost of living/gas/taxes/etc. 

I have gotten feedback from other military families that are/were stationed in Anchorage, but their feedback of course is coming from a military spouse/service member perspective. 

What are some things we should know about prior to arriving? We are extremely excited to embrace the beauty and lifestyle change that is sure to come with moving to Alaska vs California. What are we in for?",2023-07-13 04:46:26
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited","Visiting Alaska (Fairbanks) for the first time Dec 8-11, from SoCal. Advice needed.","Bringing my wife for our anniversary to Fairbanks to show her the northern lights. She has been very excited as this is our first ever trip for anniversary. I want to make sure that I check all the boxes and don't get bogged down by the weather. The weather seems scary (-20 deg C). Not sure what's the best way to prepare without having to spend too much for what's essentially a one time wear. Also, is there a way to know beforehand if we even have a chance of catching the Aurora borealis. The 27 day forecast shows that KP index is at 2 during that time which is like very low solar activity. That means very low aurora visibility. Is my understanding correct?   
Lastly, if we want to drive around, should I rent an AWD SUV or a AWD sedan works fine?   


Thank you very much. 

Edit: thank you all for helping out a novice with such patience. Hopefully, this thread will serve as and advice for people trying to visit Fairbanks in early December.  ",2023-11-28 19:09:05
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited",Moving to Juneau,"Hi all!

My fiance and myself will be coming over to Juneau for seasonal work from South Africa and we have a few questions, if anyone would be able to help we would greatly appreciate it!

1. What is the least costly manner to send money back home?
2. What essentials would we need upon arrival (much warmer clothes than what we require in SA seems obvious, but we are unsure about what kind of shoes and jackets would work best) 
3. Would stocking up on disposables such as bars of soap and toothpaste beforehand be a good move or is the price difference not large enough to justify flying with a bag of cleaning materials?
4. How difficult or easy is it to adapt to the new area (both culturally and weather wise.
5. Anything else that we need to be made aware of or that we might need and wouldnt be able to find over there?

Thank you all in advance, super excited for the new journey!",2024-04-04 11:35:47
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited",How do we pack/dress/travel for December weather in a glass igloo?,"We are traveling to Alaska this Dec for 4 days to stay in the glass igloos and see the aurora! I can’t be more excited! Except for the fact that I was born and raised in the desert and I’m still always cold. I’ve literally never been in more than 4 in of snow and I’ve never been in colder than 20 degree weather. I have NO IDEA how to dress for such cold weather. I’m also unlikely to wear most of it more than 5x over the next 20 years so I don’t want to drop a fortune. But I also don’t want to be cold. Eek! I’ve tried googling but I’m super overwhelmed by options, brands, and opinions. Can you help me simplify this? 

- What do I def need? 
- What is worth investing in versus renting? (For instance they offer overboots to rent. Is that a good option or too cold to wear over some basic winter boots?)
- What brands are warm enough and decent quality but still budget friendly? 
- Any other tips to help a desert rat to survive the cold? 

And also what in the world do I wear on the plane since I’m leaving a warm climate and flying into 4 degree weather? Do ppl just change on the plane or at the airport after they land?",2023-09-13 00:36:19
Alaska,BOTH,"weather,excited",Just booked my tix for Alaska Sep 16-23rd,"I’ve been trying to plan Alaska with Friends/fam so long, since it’s never been possible I’m doing it solo. I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

UPDATE: something’s I have booked can still be canceled or changed for a fee, is it worth rescheduling my flight to 12th through 18th? (Will the weather, and overall opportunities be better?)",2023-09-02 11:57:30
Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,love","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks!

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48.

Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,like","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,like","""I saw houses being washed away in Alaska. Stop the victim blaming""","It was a hot, sunny day in Alaska's capital city, uncharacteristic of the largest temperate rainforest in the world. My nineteen-year-old niece and I were chatting about global warming, as Alaskans do whenever we get too hot.

“Global warming?” my niece laughed. “More like global *burning*.”

Hours later, ice melt that had accumulated in a Mendenhall Glacier basin over the last year crested the glacial dam.

Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,like",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"sunny,like",The Last Frontier (Poem),"Hi everyone! I made a poem from when I lived in Alaska some years ago, I really miss Alaska and will be going back later this year. Let me know what you think, this was written some time ago and now just decided to share this:

Freedom of continuing in existence,
Appreciating life as it is bliss.
Blessed were my eyes with your rapids,
New lands,
Filled with rivers and salmon in abundance.

There could be many adventures, but you,
You came to me with a calling,
Yes, you, who have given me hope,
With your towering mountains and evergreen forests,
Your glacial ice that glistens like diamonds.

Take the clouds, bring the snow, 
Run the rivers, and take my soul, 
Throw your breeze in my direction, 
May it be cold or hot, 
Be it sunny or night, I will be yours.

Oh, land of mysteries and untamed beauty,
Take my soul and be my nurture,
Give me your peaceful land with no fear,
Where eagles soar and bears roam,
Give me the freedom to explore you,
Oh, Last Frontier.",2023-07-06 14:40:33

The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"rainy,love",Visiting in June?,"Planning a trip next year and trying to figure out when is best. I’ve been up once for a month of work in October but it was pretty rainy.

Have about a week and would like to do some fishing and whale watching etc. 

Was thinking to fly into Anchorage do the Kenai peninsula or go to Juneau?
Would love to hear suggestions on what to see/where to go!

Would like to see a bit more sun than last time trying to avoid too much heat so was thinking June or September?",2024-05-17 17:00:48
Alaska,BOTH,"rainy,love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47
Alaska,BOTH,"rainy,hate",PSA - xtratufs are not fashionable….,"Ladies of Alaska, I hate to break it to you but xtratufs are rain boots and should be worn appropriately. I realize they have “cute” prints on the liner, but still, they are to be worn in rainy/fishing/wet areas.  Please stop being lazy and put some efforts into your look!! You’re better than that (I wish).",2023-10-03 01:45:29

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

My car is older and I'm worried about being stranded on the highway.
I've read a lot about the lower 48 to Juneau but haven't seen much about Portland to Juneau specifically. Here are my questions:

Are the road conditions in April passable?

Where can you camp in your car along the way/ where are the best places to stay?

Recommended routes or ways to break up the trip? i.e. how many hours for how many days.
We're trying to make this a shorter trip since it's just for work, not really sight seeing.

Anything helps!! We're trying to be in Juneau April 13th. Thank you!",2024-02-29 00:33:36

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days? 

&#x200B;

Thank you!",2023-03-30 04:29:22
Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,like","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it

* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state!

Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,like",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Thank you!",2023-12-05 01:47:15
Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,like",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,like",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,like",Abnormal weather!,"Hi everyone! I have seen from other posts that this year’s weather is colder and more cloudy/rainy, where you are how different has it been from the past few years? And how do you predict the rest of the summer will look like?",2023-06-15 06:41:50
Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,worried",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,scared",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
Alaska,BOTH,"cloudy,excited","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,love",Alaska without a car,"Hello y’all! I’m planning a trip to Alaska to see the northern lights + and I’d love to know experiences of whoever did this trip without a car. Im a backpacker and never rent a cat, so I’m familiar with the prices of cabs such uber/Lyft and the delays of public transportation. Also I don’t even know how to drive on snow, and I don’t think Alaska would be the place to practice. I wanna see the lights, go to North Pole, hot springs, dog sleigh rides etc. touristic stuff.

Are there ways to go around without a car? There are shuffles to those places? People you can hire to drive you around? 

I wanna hear from tourists and also locals! 


TIA",2023-11-20 16:34:26
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,love",M(27) visiting Alaska for work in late March. ,"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao. APPRECIATE YA

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,hate",Advice for moving to and finding work in Alaska?,"I am in the early stages of looking into what it would take to move to and find work in Alaska, as I grew up in colder climates (not Alaska cold) and really hate being hot all the time. On top of the fact that the Alaskan lifestyle and beautiful landscapes are much nicer to photograph than the mojave desert. I much prefer being cold all the time. I've got a car, a passport, 3 cats, and two rooms worth of stuff. I could fit pretty much everything I care about except my fridge, desk, and dresser into my car. What would be the most affordable way to move that stuff?
Also, I have been looking at various job websites, but I'm wondering if anyone has a better strategy for this. I'm trying to find work, ideally in IT as I am A+ certified. But I currently work as a technical service writer/customer service/IT Manager at an RV repair shop for about 3 years.

Any advice is appreciated!

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for all the advice & information, it has been extremely helpful!",2023-11-01 21:45:28
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,enjoy",M(27) visiting Alaska for work in late March. ,"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao. APPRECIATE YA

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",I’m homeless and losing hope ,"I recently moved from wasilla to anchorage after falling on hard times and becoming homeless about 2 months ago. My girlfriend and I are both living in my tiny ford focus and it’s been rough.

I’ve had a hard past and had made some mistakes but am now on the straight and narrow. Neither of us use drugs and we both got full time jobs less than a week after moving here. We work retail and have managed to save around $2000 and are currently looking for housing. I’m contemplating staying at a shitty motel since I’ve been wasting money on application fees on apartments. I’ve applied for 5 now and have been turned down each time due to my record. No felonies but theres been some mistakes.

Ive changed since then and learned from my mistakes. I’m a good person, I try to do good and help those around me and stay far away from trouble now. I have no family or friends out here and I’m starting to lose hope. Maybe I’m just destined to live like this forever and it won’t get better.  I feel like anybody should get a second chance and I feel like I’ve been making all the right and healthy decisions lately but it’s hard to stay positive.

I just reaching out in case anyone knows of any housing or any communities that could help us. We have food stamps and our work is letting us stay in the parking lot to sleep. We use the food pantry to get food every now and then. I just want a roof over my head before it gets too cold. I’m tired of feeling judged and looked down upon or like I’m a drug addict because I’ve fallen on hard times. Being homeless is not easy. Constantly trying to find time to shower and what to eat, or where to sleep, wondering if I’ll ever be able to find housing, staying warm. Our eating habits are terrible right now. No hot food except fast food and it’s destroying my stomach. And working 40+ hours a week at a shitty retail store on top of that with no bed to come home to.

I hope all of my hard work pays off soon because I’m starting to lose hope. If anyone could help or give me any advice I’d be grateful. Peace ✌️",2024-09-08 06:52:12
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",Ideas for care packages for homeless (Anchorage) ,"I know the homeless are bothersome for most but I would like to help them this year. They don’t deserve to freeze to death. I see a lot of individuals in sleeping bags or even on the ground. If they miss curfew or the shelter is full, they really have no where to go and struggle to stay warm. Some do have jobs but cannot get housing. 

I am wondering if there is a laundromat that does tokens or gift vouchers in Anchorage, that is somewhat centrally located. I would like to give them a “load of clean laundry”.

I have the following on my list: 

Hats 
Gloves 
Socks
Beanies 
Hot hands warmer
Hot feet warmers
Foil blankets 
Feminine hygiene products 
Condoms 
Shower wipes 
Flushable wipes 
Tide pods
Cup of Noodles (microwaveable) 

Anything I should add ? 

Edit: I added toothpaste, toothbrush, first aid kits, deodorant to my Amazon cart. I am thinking I will buy small bottles or containers and filling them with shampoo/conditioner/body wash 

I don’t plan on going into “homeless” camps. I have “regulars” I see on my patrols that sleep in doorways and cars. These are the people I’d like to help immediately. I feel terrible asking individuals to leave back into the cold. 

I think a cup of soup would be nice. I could carry a thermos of hot water to make it on the spot. Hand warmers and feet warmers would probably make a good gift as well. ",2024-11-10 07:50:17
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",What’s your favorite thing to do in the lower 48 when you leave Alaska?,"Going on a trip to the lower 48 from a small remote community in southeast for the first time in a while, won’t be leaving again after this for some time. What’s your favorite thing to do while you’re out of Alaska? I’m thinking about things like seeing a movie in a theater, going to a hot yoga class, shopping at Trader Joe’s, creature comfort type things! What things do you look forward to when you are in civilization?",2023-10-08 18:52:52
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like","What has to be happen, that Alaska will face much more migration?","Alaska has arround  733,391 Inhabitants, which is a joke given the enormous size of the country. Even a state like Utah or Arizona, which are not only 6-7x smaller, have 5x or even 10x more inhabitants and they basically only consist of hot desert.  But even northern countries with the same latitude as Finland or Norway have 8 to 9 times as many inhabitants and Norway is, on average, significantly more mountainous.  

So what is going wrong in Alaska that so few people live there? What needs to change significantly so that more people from around the world can imagine life in Alaska and finally develop the country sensibly, with metropolises etc. ",2024-02-21 03:20:45
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",Toyostove help,"Hey so i got a toyostove laser 560 serviced from total toyo and it quit working after about 3 weeks. I get code e-2. The ignitor still gets hot so I cleaned the flame sensor with no luck and just replaced it as its $8. Still getting the same code. I have 2 other toyos hooked up in line after this one which both work just fine so it's not a fuel issue as this one is getting fuel. I'm at a loss as to what I would need to check on next? I would like to assume everything is clean and airflow is not an issue. I have basic+ knowledge/tools for fuel, electric, and combustion ljust don't know what direction to take. Any help is much appreciated 🙏

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like","""I saw houses being washed away in Alaska. Stop the victim blaming""","It was a hot, sunny day in Alaska's capital city, uncharacteristic of the largest temperate rainforest in the world. My nineteen-year-old niece and I were chatting about global warming, as Alaskans do whenever we get too hot.

“Global warming?” my niece laughed. “More like global *burning*.”

Hours later, ice melt that had accumulated in a Mendenhall Glacier basin over the last year crested the glacial dam.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",Are you a fan of Kenai dip? I’ve been working on my own recipe: Kruzof dip. ,"1 ½ cups cottage cheese

1 cup (8-ounce brick) cream cheese, softened

½ cup mayonnaise

1 teaspoon paprika, smoked or hot

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon onion powder

Pinch of salt, to taste

Splash of Worcestershire

Splash of lemon juice

½ teaspoon liquid smoke

1 can (7 ounces) chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, preferably Embasa brand, chopped finely

1 to 2 cups shredded cheese

8 to 16 ounces smoked salmon, chopped or torn into small pieces


1. ​Thoroughly combine the cottage cheese, cream cheese, and mayonnaise using a blender, immersion blender, or food processor **until smooth**. A hand or stand mixer may be an option, but you want to ensure the cottage cheese is no longer lumpy. 

2. Add seasonings (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, Worcestershire, lemon juice, and liquid smoke) and mix thoroughly. 

3. Mix in shredded cheese and finely chopped chipotle peppers, to taste. If you prefer less spice, start with half of the peppers. 

4. Mix in smoked salmon, using more or less based on how chunky you like your dip. 

This recipe is very forgiving and I rarely measure everything out. Taste as you go along and adjust to your liking. You may be able to substitute sour cream, extra mayonnaise, or perhaps ricotta in place of the cottage cheese, but cottage cheese is very high in protein and lends itself well to the flavor and texture of this recipe. I personally wanted something with a little more nutritional bang for my buck. 

Feel free to top with green onions, more cheese, etc. Tastes best after sitting in the fridge overnight. Good on Juanita's chips, pretzel thins, raw veggie sticks, or a bagel.",2024-09-19 20:35:06
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",Advice,"Hello!

I recently graduated with my Masters in Social Work and I'm planning a trip to Alaska in September to celebrate. I'm hoping to see the Northern Lights which is the reason we are traveling in September (I know they aren't a gauruntee and I've always wanted to visit Alaska anyway). Below is my itenerary. Looking for suggestions on places to go/things to do, but MOSTLY where to stay. Wondering if renting an RV would be a doable option or if a car and Airbnbs/Hotels are better. There will likely be 4 people in our party, all adults. We are trying to stay in a budget of $2000 per person if possible. Thank you in advance for any advice, I'm looking forward to visiting this beautiful state!

Sep 13: Fly into Anchorage, pick up rental vehicle, drive to Seward

Sep 14: Do a wildlife/glacier cruise

Sep 15: Hike Exit Glacier, explore other areas around Seward

Sep 16: Drive to Anchorage/Talkeetna, explore Turnagain Arm/Hatcher Pass

Sep 17: Drive to Healy, explore area/Denali

Sep 18: Do hikes in Denali

Sep 19: Drive to Fairbanks, look for Northern Lights

Sep 20: Visit Chena Hot Springs

Sep 21: Do Angel Wings hike or partially drive towards to Arctic Circle to see the area, still spend the night in Fairbanks

Sep 22: Drive to Anchorage

Sep 23: Fly home",2024-05-22 20:53:30

I'm think of doing RV so I don't have to worry about rental cars or hotels. 

The main things I wanna do are dog sledding, northern lights, hot springs, flight and maybe a day hike in denali, anchorage and fairbanks. Possible arctic circle but I've heard it's something  to just say that you've done it and I'm just not sure it's worth navigating how to get up there since I won't be able to take a rental. 
I've seen like 2 or 3 day dog sled expeditions to northern lights or hot springs that would be amazing.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",Thoughts on my itinerary for leaving the state?,"I’ll be starting in Anchorage and there will be two adults and two cats in the car. This is just a rough draft but I’m wondering if anyone has any input

My only worry is Anchorage to Haines Junction. It’ll be a long day for sure. Maps says 11 hours driving but can anyone speak to the accuracy of that? From my experience I like to get the longest day out of the way first and on previous road trips I’ve done up to a 12 hour day on the first day.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",M(27) visiting Alaska for work in late March. ,"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,like",Looking for tip,"Hello good people of Reddit.  

Im looking for local wisdom of alaska people.  

Friend of mine ask me for some tip what to visit in alaska in AUGUST.  He plans to do like 14 Full days .  I said i will help him.. but then i kinda realized its some time i traveled around alaska . Even though im coming there for seafood processing job quite often. 

Me friend plans to travel solo. Rent some SUV, hostels and when possible sleep in tent.  

Me kinda idea just of the top of the head : 

Anchorage 

Denali -   Wonderlake tour ( best place to see Mt.Denali) 

Fairbanks .  Museum ..  Ice Museum

Polar circle board  - 66°33′ (he wants a picture)

Coldfoot-  Arctic Interagency Visitor Center. 

Wiseman - Mining town 

Prudhoe bay.   24 hour in advance reservation . ( he wants to put feet to Arctic ocean )  

Coming back from here he deserve a break at

Chenna hot springs. 

Then go down to  

Kennicott . Mines and glacier tour

Valdez. Finish the travel alongside the pipeline from the north. 

Ferry to whitter 

whitter . 

And then back to anchorage.  I asked him if he is interested in whales. he said kinda no. Been on few tours in norway. So i kinda cut Seward from the list thanks to that.   

Me question is .  I know me list kinda look empty. Got any tips what to put on the map ? Some small local hike ?  Any tips would be appreciated .",2023-05-10 14:59:11

Freedom of continuing in existence,
Appreciating life as it is bliss.
Blessed were my eyes with your rapids,
New lands,
Filled with rivers and salmon in abundance.

There could be many adventures, but you,
You came to me with a calling,
Yes, you, who have given me hope,
With your towering mountains and evergreen forests,
Your glacial ice that glistens like diamonds.

Take the clouds, bring the snow, 
Run the rivers, and take my soul, 
Throw your breeze in my direction, 
May it be cold or hot, 
Be it sunny or night, I will be yours.

Oh, land of mysteries and untamed beauty,
Take my soul and be my nurture,
Give me your peaceful land with no fear,
Where eagles soar and bears roam,
Give me the freedom to explore you,
Oh, Last Frontier.",2023-07-06 14:40:33
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,worried",Best layers and sleeping bag for end of June outside Anchorage?,"My teen is spending a week camping with a guide/ group of other teens at the end of June and I'm just trying to get recommendations for what layers are most comfortable for the swing in temps and mosquitoes? They'll be a couple hours outside of Anchorage, and they're doing the typical outdoorsy activities, a smaller hike, group team building we might expect to see for a teen summer trip. He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm. We do need to be budget conscious, he's on scholarship we aren't ""just"" putting him on a plane to Alaska for a week lol, but I'm also not worried about whether we'll ever use the gear again, my 12 yo goes camping with scouts frequently so things will get used.

Alaska,BOTH,"hot,excited","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"hot,excited",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love","Thinking of moving, need ideas","30f. The long, cold, dark winters seem to be getting worse and I need new scenery (physically and mentally) to grow as a person and gain more experience. 

I love the small town feel of the valley while still having access to decent amenities. 

I can’t do big cities and spend an hour in traffic every day. 

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons. 

But not regular temperatures over 90.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Am I Crazy?,"Hello, y'all! I'm a Texan hoping to vacation up in Alaska at some point next year in 2025, when money hopefully won't be quite as tight, been saving up a while. It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway). Here's where things get a little funky, though not at all serious

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit! But what do I know, I'm not Alaskan. On the other hand, y'all are, so what do y'all think? Am I really crazy? Hope y'all had a great new year up there!",2024-01-02 05:45:35
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Where to move?,"My wife and I are considering moving to Alaska, and I’d rather ask people who live there then wade through “top 10” google searches. I worked in Alaska a number of years ago in soldotna, we are both Eastern WA natives, so cold and winter are normal for us and we are making a list of towns to check out. We are in our early 30’s with one child, we are moderate/libertarian politically, looking for a community but also large enough we would still have some stuff to do. Preferably coastal, would love to own a few acres out side town if possible. Professionally my wife has a criminal justice psychology degree but has worked in an receptionist/insurance for years. I’m a diesel mechanic but have a side business in videography. We are aware of the winter darkness, midnight sun and possibility of owning boat rather than a car lol we are reaching a point we would like to unplug from the rat race and be a little more Simple and self sufficient. Sorry for the wordy post, thanks for any advice. Also please no anchorage lol",2023-09-07 06:21:01
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Interested in Moving,"Hi!!! I’m interested in moving to Alaska. Let me tell you about myself so you can give me some recommendations. I HATE the cold, it makes me feel so sad and shivery. I also don’t like snow, however I can tolerate it when it is still in the liquid form. All that aside, let me tell you about my favorite hobbies!! I hate skiing, sledding, snowboarding, fishing, Ice fishing, hiking, driving in any condition other than plain concrete, and bending over too much. It hurts my wee little back. On the contrary, I love tanning, surfing, scuba diving, dancing, and parasailing. Let me talk about my fears. Bears are so scary!!! Luckily there are none here right! 😁 Mosquitos scare me too, and so does the dark. Me and my family were looking at Utqiagvik, as i’m sure it has all my likings. What do you think? Thanks for the feedback!

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Moving to Anchorage?,"Hello everyone! I have a quick question for all of you. I'm considering moving to Anchorage for my job. I'm originally from Central IL, but I've been living in Oklahoma City for the last few months. I love the cold and the outdoors. I really think I would enjoy living in Alaska during the spring, summer, and fall. I'm slightly concerned about living there in the winter due to the snow and ice. What are the worst parts of living in anchorage in comparison to the lower 48? Along with that, if anyone has any suggestions on where to live or good apartments that allow 2 medium sized dogs in the area or surrounding area of Anchorage I would greatly appreciate it.",2023-07-08 01:54:58

I am planning on transferring spring of 25’, and have a few schools at my current state but am also kind of looking for a change of scenery, and I love the cold. I am interested in going to med school later on and majoring in bio/chem/biochem for undergraduate. I was wondering if you guys had any insight on what schools are the best out there? I am focused primarily on the education, but campus life is also important to me. Thanks in advance!",2024-02-06 21:27:19
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Tips for Food and Clothing for First-Timers?,"**EDIT**:  Disregard!  I didn't see that r/AlaskaTravel existed when I searched Reddit.

Greetings!

My apologies if this isn't the right place or way of inquiring.

My wife and I will be visiting Alaska sometime in August of this year with another couple, and we'll be staying in Seward, Anchorage, Homer, and perhaps one other city.

None of us have ever been, and are just starting to do research.  My wife and I are responsible for coming up with multiple restaurant options for the cities where we'll be staying.  I found a travel blog from a former native that seemed pretty good for the cities I listed above, but I was wondering if anyone had suggestions of their own.

We have no food allergies, are open to anything, and we plan to avoid the usual tourist traps where possible.  The four of us prefer to immerse ourselves in the culture wherever we go, but at the same time, we have no interest in rubbing shoulders where we wouldn't at least be tolerated.  Specifically, we would NOT be looking to force ""a connection"" with the locals.  We want to enjoy the food, the scenery, and the grandeur while always being respectful of everyone just living their daily lives.

My wife and I would also love some suggestions on clothing.  We'll be taking a ship to see glaciers and also doing a panning for gold thing, so our tenderfoot asses are definitely going to be spending a lot of time outdoors.  I've been on the East Coast in December, but I'm sure that's just a fraction of the kind of cold we might encounter.

We have an REI in our town, but we'd prefer to get recommendations from those who've tested their gear on a daily basis instead of relying on someone who's never been ""on the ground"" and just wants to move product that they've never worn themselves.

Thanks very much!",2024-03-04 20:29:14

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,love",Where to go next,"I spent the summer with a family member in Anchorage and had the opportunity to visit a lot of places in that area as well as Homer and Seward and even up to Denali for a weekend of backcountry camping in unit 10. Loved all of it, especially the friendly people.

I am hoping to come up again before the main tourist season begins but am not sure where to go this time. Of course I love camping but I think it's probably still too cold for that so I am content with just walking around and taking some photos. I thought about flying up to Ketchikan from Seattle and heading over to Sitka but it seems those towns are big for cruises and the last thing I want is being around mobs of cruisers. Are these two towns easily walkable without needing a car?

Nome seems like an interesting city. Would that be worth visiting for a few days?

I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Edit: forgot to mention that at least in my town, outsiders are truly hated sometimes and when people move there it's actually horrifying seeing how they are treated. It's like the locals want to drive everyone out of town. It took my mom a year to even make friends there when she moved because so many people were trashing her saying there was no way she'd make it and that she would leave soon, then she ended up staying and became good friends with everyone.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,hate","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,hate",Overcoming Nostalgia ,"My family and I moved away from AK over 7 years ago when I was just 11 years old... but as each year passes and the more l've grown up and come of age living in California, the harder and more homesick I get for Alaska. It's become so bad to the point where not a day goes by when I don't start reminiscing and thinking back to growing up in such a beautiful place.
For context, I was born in Fairbanks and my family and I moved a lot across AK, mainly in small villages (only accessible by bush plane) across Central and Northern Alaska. It was so hard for us to live, but now when I look back I only see the positives.

I know it's not the most ideal state for living, and I remember when I was actually growing up there I really hated it. I hated living in Alaska as a kid because it felt so isolating and lonely and obviously very cold, and it was difficult for my parents to provide for my siblings and I and I could see the toll it took on them to work and live in quite literally the middle of nowhere.

I think I've just grown bitter about living in the Bay Area and am sick of the cost of living and sheer volume of people that live here, and l've also grown fearful that living in the Bay has made me lose my identity as an Alaskan and lose a lot of the qualities I like to think Alaskans have like resilience and grit and toughness. Or maybe I just miss being a kid, like most people. My family and l often discuss wanting to go back to Anchorage or Fairbanks just for a visit, but it's never come to fruition because of how
expensive a trip would be. I honestly don't want to go back to living in Alaska, but it's been over 7 years since l've left and I just want to return back to the place where I was born and raised even just for a little bit. Sorry for the venting, I just wasn't sure where else to put this.",2024-10-04 06:11:45
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,hate",Advice for moving to and finding work in Alaska?,"I am in the early stages of looking into what it would take to move to and find work in Alaska, as I grew up in colder climates (not Alaska cold) and really hate being hot all the time.

I've got a car, a passport, 3 cats, and two rooms worth of stuff. I could fit pretty much everything I care about except my fridge, desk, and dresser into my car. What would be the most affordable way to move that stuff?

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

What are your thoughts?",2024-01-29 05:04:43
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway).

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit!

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,enjoy",Moving to Anchorage?,"Hello everyone! I have a quick question for all of you. I'm considering moving to Anchorage for my job. I'm originally from Central IL, but I've been living in Oklahoma City for the last few months. I love the cold and the outdoors. I really think I would enjoy living in Alaska during the spring, summer, and fall. I'm slightly concerned about living there in the winter due to the snow and ice. What are the worst parts of living in anchorage in comparison to the lower 48? Along with that, if anyone has any suggestions on where to live or good apartments that allow 2 medium sized dogs in the area or surrounding area of Anchorage I would greatly appreciate it.",2023-07-08 01:54:58
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,enjoy",Tips for Food and Clothing for First-Timers?,"**EDIT**:  Disregard!  I didn't see that r/AlaskaTravel existed when I searched Reddit.

Greetings!

My apologies if this isn't the right place or way of inquiring.

My wife and I will be visiting Alaska sometime in August of this year with another couple, and we'll be staying in Seward, Anchorage, Homer, and perhaps one other city.

None of us have ever been, and are just starting to do research.  My wife and I are responsible for coming up with multiple restaurant options for the cities where we'll be staying.  I found a travel blog from a former native that seemed pretty good for the cities I listed above, but I was wondering if anyone had suggestions of their own.

We have no food allergies, are open to anything, and we plan to avoid the usual tourist traps where possible.  The four of us prefer to immerse ourselves in the culture wherever we go, but at the same time, we have no interest in rubbing shoulders where we wouldn't at least be tolerated.  Specifically, we would NOT be looking to force ""a connection"" with the locals.  We want to enjoy the food, the scenery, and the grandeur while always being respectful of everyone just living their daily lives.

My wife and I would also love some suggestions on clothing.  We'll be taking a ship to see glaciers and also doing a panning for gold thing, so our tenderfoot asses are definitely going to be spending a lot of time outdoors.  I've been on the East Coast in December, but I'm sure that's just a fraction of the kind of cold we might encounter.

We have an REI in our town, but we'd prefer to get recommendations from those who've tested their gear on a daily basis instead of relying on someone who's never been ""on the ground"" and just wants to move product that they've never worn themselves.

Thanks very much!",2024-03-04 20:29:14
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,enjoy",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

People are always asking me what it was like living in Alaska and I have a generic response about the beautiful nature and small island I'm from, but really it is ROUGH especially if you're not the exact type of person who wants to live there.

Edit: forgot to mention that at least in my town, outsiders are truly hated sometimes and when people move there it's actually horrifying seeing how they are treated. It's like the locals want to drive everyone out of town. It took my mom a year to even make friends there when she moved because so many people were trashing her saying there was no way she'd make it and that she would leave soon, then she ended up staying and became good friends with everyone. She tells that story like it's nice but it actually shows how unwelcoming it is. Maybe it's just my town that's that way, but jfc I could go onnn.",2023-11-02 21:26:08
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",I’m homeless and losing hope ,"I recently moved from wasilla to anchorage after falling on hard times and becoming homeless about 2 months ago. My girlfriend and I are both living in my tiny ford focus and it’s been rough.

I’ve had a hard past and had made some mistakes but am now on the straight and narrow. Neither of us use drugs and we both got full time jobs less than a week after moving here. We work retail and have managed to save around $2000 and are currently looking for housing. I’m contemplating staying at a shitty motel since I’ve been wasting money on application fees on apartments. I’ve applied for 5 now and have been turned down each time due to my record. No felonies but theres been some mistakes.

Ive changed since then and learned from my mistakes. I’m a good person, I try to do good and help those around me and stay far away from trouble now. I have no family or friends out here and I’m starting to lose hope. Maybe I’m just destined to live like this forever and it won’t get better.  I feel like anybody should get a second chance and I feel like I’ve been making all the right and healthy decisions lately but it’s hard to stay positive.

I just reaching out in case anyone knows of any housing or any communities that could help us. We have food stamps and our work is letting us stay in the parking lot to sleep. We use the food pantry to get food every now and then. I just want a roof over my head before it gets too cold. I’m tired of feeling judged and looked down upon or like I’m a drug addict because I’ve fallen on hard times. Being homeless is not easy. Constantly trying to find time to shower and what to eat, or where to sleep, wondering if I’ll ever be able to find housing, staying warm. Our eating habits are terrible right now. No hot food except fast food and it’s destroying my stomach. And working 40+ hours a week at a shitty retail store on top of that with no bed to come home to.

I hope all of my hard work pays off soon because I’m starting to lose hope. If anyone could help or give me any advice I’d be grateful. Peace ✌️",2024-09-08 06:52:12

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Ideas for care packages for homeless (Anchorage) ,"I know the homeless are bothersome for most but I would like to help them this year. They don’t deserve to freeze to death. I see a lot of individuals in sleeping bags or even on the ground. If they miss curfew or the shelter is full, they really have no where to go and struggle to stay warm. Some do have jobs but cannot get housing. 

I am wondering if there is a laundromat that does tokens or gift vouchers in Anchorage, that is somewhat centrally located. I would like to give them a “load of clean laundry”.

I have the following on my list: 

Hats 
Gloves 
Socks
Beanies 
Hot hands warmer
Hot feet warmers
Foil blankets 
Feminine hygiene products 
Condoms 
Shower wipes 
Flushable wipes 
Tide pods
Cup of Noodles (microwaveable) 

Anything I should add ? 

Edit: I added toothpaste, toothbrush, first aid kits, deodorant to my Amazon cart. I am thinking I will buy small bottles or containers and filling them with shampoo/conditioner/body wash 

I don’t plan on going into “homeless” camps. I have “regulars” I see on my patrols that sleep in doorways and cars. These are the people I’d like to help immediately. I feel terrible asking individuals to leave back into the cold. 

I think a cup of soup would be nice. I could carry a thermos of hot water to make it on the spot. Hand warmers and feet warmers would probably make a good gift as well. ",2024-11-10 07:50:17

I'm looking at downcoats right now, I was told there is a big difference in warmth and that down should be bought for the winter. 

I'm looking at two pieces right now, they have different down to waterfowl feathers ratios, for one is pretty much all down, and one is half and half. I have no clue what this means, or if it's that big of a difference to my old coat. 

If anyone could let me know anything about coats I'd really appreciate it! A bit scared for the winter, and I run cold. I already got rabbit fur Italian leather gloves (I don't like wool touching my hands) and thick alpaca socks.",2024-10-01 03:55:00

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Looking to move to an Inuit community in Alaska,"Hello, I am considering moving to Alaska for work for a year or two. I usually like to visit places before moving there to see if I like it but I currently live outside of North America about a 25 hour flight away even from Anchorage so it's a bit unfeasible and too expensive to do so and I don't have the leave to take off work for it.  Therefore, I was hoping you guys might have some advice for me instead. 

I am Inuit so would like somewhere that has a sizeable Inuit community (or at least of another closely related eskimo people like Yupik, Aleut, Inupiat, Sugpiaq, or Alutiiq). Even better if there are still speakers of their native language. The town I grew up in had around 6000 people so I don't mind the size so much although preferably somewhere not too small or that is at least close to a larger settlement for the infrastructure and buying things. If it's somewhere that's still within an hour or so from a major town/city then that would be perfect. What is the crime like in Alaska?

I really like hiking so somewhere with beautiful scenery that is accessible for that would be nice. I do spearfishing as well although I'm guessing it's too cold for that in Alaska? Is hunting available pretty much everywhere or only some regions?

Also, sorry to ask and no offense meant, but I have heard people say that Alaska is kinda racist towards indigenous people. The people I've met from Alaska have all been very likeable though so I was wondering is that true or just a myth? I have an Inuit first name so will I be fine using it on job applications or should I put an English nickname instead?

Thanks in advance everyone!",2024-02-24 22:01:12

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like","The Depicting Alaska in TV Shows, Movies and Video Games Checklist for Dummies","With the first trailer for the 4th season of True Detective having dropped recently, I've been thinking about how every single TV show, movie or video game set in Alaska all feature the same exact stuff to really beat the viewer/player over the head with the fact that ""This is Alaska and Alaska is different!""

So, in no particular order:

* A scene with a moose where the main character acts like it's the most majestic animal they've ever seen.  Why do these things never depict them as the tank-sized garden terrorists that they are?
* Wolves and bears are treated like they're the greatest threat to human survival since sliced bread.
* Bonus: That one scene where you can hear wolves howling in the background and someone makes a remark about how it's not safe to linger.
* Someone will point out multiple times per episode that it's like -40, just to drive the point across that it's really cold.
* Bonus: It's set in winter because Alaska never experiences summer, spring or fall.
* Every character likes hockey.
* There are no cities in Alaska, only endless forests, tundra or mountains.
* There always a prepper-hunter-outdoorsman who lives in a shack with his sled dog team, is around 50-60yo and has a grey-speckled beard.
* There's always an aerial shot of the main characters on snow machines riding across a vast snowfield dotted with the occasional copse of trees.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Cold weather photographers?

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Vanning it for College in Anchorage,"I'm hoping to be attending University of Alaska Anchorage starting next fall. I've been living out of a van for 4 years (including wintering through at ski resorts in Washington). So I'm comfortable in the cold with my setup, having experienced the struggle of -20 degree nights, and cold days with little to no sun. The intention however, is to do long-term stays Fall-Spring at RV parks (I've found 3 already, right near the University that would be open for that kind of stay).   


I suppose my questions are these: during winter, how are the roads within Anchorage? I assume that like mountain towns in WA, they'd have pretty good road clearing systems. Are power outages common? This could come as a heavy hit if it's longer than a few days in a van that's generally staying hooked up all the time. What types of communal areas are generally available during the winter? Are places like coffee shops and libraries where you can hang out and study without being on campus fairly common? And any other comments you might have that may be helpful. Just for clarification purposes though, bear in mind - I am comfortably familiar with living out of a van in harsh winter conditions. Looking at record highs and lows, and average highs and lows and snow fall amounts - what's up there seems to be pretty well within the same parameters I usually operate in during the winter when living at ski resorts for the winter in the van.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Overcoming Nostalgia ,"My family and I moved away from AK over 7 years ago when I was just 11 years old... but as each year passes and the more l've grown up and come of age living in California, the harder and more homesick I get for Alaska. It's become so bad to the point where not a day goes by when I don't start reminiscing and thinking back to growing up in such a beautiful place.
For context, I was born in Fairbanks and my family and I moved a lot across AK, mainly in small villages (only accessible by bush plane) across Central and Northern Alaska. It was so hard for us to live, but now when I look back I only see the positives.

I know it's not the most ideal state for living, and I remember when I was actually growing up there I really hated it. I hated living in Alaska as a kid because it felt so isolating and lonely and obviously very cold, and it was difficult for my parents to provide for my siblings and I and I could see the toll it took on them to work and live in quite literally the middle of nowhere.

I think I've just grown bitter about living in the Bay Area and am sick of the cost of living and sheer volume of people that live here, and l've also grown fearful that living in the Bay has made me lose my identity as an Alaskan and lose a lot of the qualities I like to think Alaskans have like resilience and grit and toughness. Or maybe I just miss being a kid, like most people. My family and l often discuss wanting to go back to Anchorage or Fairbanks just for a visit, but it's never come to fruition because of how
expensive a trip would be. I honestly don't want to go back to living in Alaska, but it's been over 7 years since l've left and I just want to return back to the place where I was born and raised even just for a little bit.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like","Looking for testimonies for my bachelor thesis : negative emotions (discomfort, wanting to quit) on long cold tours in the nature","Hey!

I am starting a bachelor thesis for my ""Nature guiding and arctic outdoor life"" degree.  
I would like to write it about the physical discomfort and the negative emotions during long ski tours. I think maybe writing in the Alaska reddit would put me in touche with some who like arctic adventure :)   
  
I have not decided of my research question yet, but here are some questions I am interested in:

* **evolution** of the negative feelings: does it get better or worse, and why?
* **nature** of the negative feelings: temperature, anxiety, unknown, equipment fail, loneliness, boredom, phyiscal pain, bad smell, being dirty, being sweaty....
* **coping mechanism**: state of mind, actual improvement, ignoring your needs...

I am trying to collect testimonies and information to have an idea of what could be an interresting focus. My focus is long solo ski tours in cold climate (under -10 degrees), but I can for sure find interesting information in long tours with more than 1 person, and with another means of transportation - snow shoes, dogs... in remote nature.

Thank you for your help!",2024-09-20 11:42:20
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Where to move?,"My wife and I are considering moving to Alaska, and I’d rather ask people who live there then wade through “top 10” google searches. I worked in Alaska a number of years ago in soldotna, we are both Eastern WA natives, so cold and winter are normal for us and we are making a list of towns to check out. We are in our early 30’s with one child, we are moderate/libertarian politically, looking for a community but also large enough we would still have some stuff to do. Preferably coastal, would love to own a few acres out side town if possible. Professionally my wife has a criminal justice psychology degree but has worked in an receptionist/insurance for years. I’m a diesel mechanic but have a side business in videography. We are aware of the winter darkness, midnight sun and possibility of owning boat rather than a car lol we are reaching a point we would like to unplug from the rat race and be a little more Simple and self sufficient. Sorry for the wordy post, thanks for any advice. Also please no anchorage lol",2023-09-07 06:21:01
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?  Specifically Anchorage, but maybe Fairbanks, which I gather means a few tens of degrees colder...

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Thanks in advance, I look forward to hearing y'all's suggestions!",2024-01-10 23:10:52
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Travel Nurse Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I am a nurse who is looking to pick up some travel contracts. The ones I have been looking at the most (I.e. the ones that pay the most) have been listings in Alaska, specifically Juneau and Anchorage. I’ve been looking to leave my current job for a while, and would like to start this contract as soon as I hit my two year mark with them in mid January. However, I also know how intense winter is over there so I’m hoping to get some advice on when would be the best time to go/how bad of an idea it would be to start my contract sometime in mid/late February.

Some context: I am from New England so I’m no stranger to cold weather in the winter and the contracts I’m looking at would provide me with housing so i wouldn’t have to worry about that. I was also planning on leasing a car once I get there.

Thanks so much!",2023-11-19 15:01:44
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Seriously considering a move to good ole Alaska,"I am sure this is a crazy common post, but here is yet another. Delete if not allowed (: 

My husband and I (both 26) are looking to move to Alaska. I’ve always wanted to go, and he is up for the adventure. We both prefer cold and aren’t really a fan of having super closer neighbors (we can currently see into our neighbors house. It sucks). 

I am a software developer, and he is in school to be a teacher. We are both veterans with clearances. 

We have 7 pets (4 dogs 3 cats), looking for a house to grow a family in (so like a 3 bed at least) and acreage to let our dogs stretch their legs (up to 5, don’t need a lot). We were looking at Fairbanks or Juneau. I know they’re pretty far apart, but just to give y’all something to work off of. 

So, with the formalities out of the way, what do you think we could expect in finding jobs, a house, life and community? Pros and cons? What to do to prepare? We will probably drive and will probably look into getting a new vehicle as well. I want a 4Runner, he wants a truck. We will be able to live off of one car for awhile. Which would be better? If neither, what should we get?

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Fairbanks College Student with Heart disease and no health insurance.,"Hello, thank you for your consideration.

I'm a university student and I have 2 students jobs at the university. But I recently was told by my on-campus doctor I have extremely high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, she was very concerned. 

I'm in shape physically, I eat healthy and don't have a lot of bodyfat, so there's not much lifestyle changes I can make, except more sleep.

Unfortunately, I'm in Interior Alaska and I have no healthcare. I applied for medicaid and so I may have it at some point? 

There's very few cardiologists here and only one accepts medicaid and they said I have to wait until May to get seen. If I do have state medicaid, I can only be seen in state, so I guess Anchorage would be my only other major option.

I'm getting more exhausted everyday and the doctor said no exercise, stay in phone service range because I might have to make a 911 call at any moment. So it's hard to sleep, in case I need to call 911. It's hard to focus at school, Im not panicking, I'm being pretty calm all things considered. But my life and memories are popping into my head and all I can think about is everyday, I smell blood, have worse vision, feel cold flowing across my chest and my heart feels like its working harder and harder. 

I just wish I spent less time working and studying if this is all the time I had.

Does anyone have any advice?",2024-02-05 08:38:16

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Return from vacation,"Look, these weeks I was in Alaska. To learn English. And also to get to know a little more, and the truth is that Alaska seemed like a good place to me. With a great summer and a very cold climate. Obviously the summer was also rainy, but the heat made me forget that. The truth was that it was an excellent 5-month experience. I'm already in my country and it was good while it lasted.",2024-08-21 23:54:01

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Palmer-Wasilla job opportunity,"I've recently been presented with a possible opportunity to move to the Palmer-Wasilla area, and looking for what the reality is of moving from the lower 48 to that area. I was looking at housing in Palmer, Butte, and possibly as far south as Eagle River (but I don't know if the commute to Palmer is doable in the winter from there).  


I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

I feel like I'm smart enough to know, that I don't know nearly enough about the area - so, grateful for whatever help anyone can provide. ",2024-03-15 21:58:19
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",University of Alaska Anchorage vs Fairbanks ,"Hi this is my first reddit post so I apologize if it seems disorienting or confusing to read. I had recently got accepted into both Fairbanks and Anchorage for the fall semester of 2024. I'm 21, Male, from Germany but have moved pretty much everywhere it seems. Arizona, Texas, Nevada, North Carolina, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, Montreal, Milan, Paris, Multiple cities in Germany. I plan on accepting one or the other, as I have been offered instate. I plan on majoring in languages (German/English/Russian) I am even open to majoring in Computer Science.

I don't necessarily have a favorite, I really just want to be social and make some friends while I develope myself into being a better person. One of my concerns falls on healthcare, I have had multiple surgeries done on my lower body that often needs to be checked. I have also been labeled with Hashimotos disease and I have to be checked every couple of months since I'm apparently at a high risk of thyroid cancer. I also have schizophrenia where I need meds and brain scans relatively often. I'll be going into the dorm and will start off not having a car or any gear related to the cold.

Will I absolutely need a car starting off and how much gear/clothes would I need for the environment. I have never really lived in an environment with a lot of snow. I also like to travel a lot and want to experience, hiking, fishing, biking and really want to see the northern lights. I am not afraid to drive distances, I drive all the time and became used to driving 12 hours average in one go. I really want to take Alaska by the balls! Go everywhere and do everything, when I have breaks from school. For context I also don't have any contacts or know anyone or anything about Alaska. 

I also have piercings, some tattoos, black nails and an accent. I don't really care about what people would think but I do like to adapt to my environment and not cause trouble or unnecessary attention. Will any of this be a major issue. Every state I have been too it hasn't been a problem but I have absolutely no clue when based off of Alaska. Also how tall are people in Alaska?

I ALSO FORGOT TO ADD, jobs are very important for me and I'm also willing to work on and off the campus.

Any information or guidance helps, thank you in advance!",2024-02-26 20:11:15

All that aside, let me tell you about my favorite hobbies!!

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Midnight sun or polar night?,"As a non-Alaskan, I’m fascinated by the extremes of Alaska when it comes to lengths of daylight or lack thereof. AKA polar night and midnight sun. I know neither is ideal, but which do you prefer? I personally think I would rather deal with the midnight sun. At least you can put blackout curtains up and simulate darkness in your home at night. To me, it seems it would be easier to simulate darkness inside during the summer months than it would be to simulate light outside in the winter months. The constant darkness also seems like it would be straight up depressing after a while. Paired with the extreme cold. I’d actually like to experience the midnight sun in person one day and visit Alaska during the summer. Which extreme do you prefer and why? Thank you 😊 !

I know that a Visa H1B is required to work in the U.S, and I need a employer sponsorship to get it. But I have some other questions I would like to know before putting to work and trying to get the visa. So I join this sub reddit to try to get some data from the Alaska residents themselves if you dont mind.

1) Is it nice to live in Alaska? Regarding the biggest cities like Anchorage o FairBanks ( considering the life costs, money savings, climate and places to know )  
2) How hard is it to get the sponsorship form an emplyoyer? There are job opportunities there?  Knowing that I have a college degree in Product Design and currently working as a project manager.  
3) Socially speaking, are Alaska residents cool people? Is it cool living there?

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,like",Where to go next,"I spent the summer with a family member in Anchorage and had the opportunity to visit a lot of places in that area as well as Homer and Seward and even up to Denali for a weekend of backcountry camping in unit 10. Loved all of it, especially the friendly people.

I am hoping to come up again before the main tourist season begins but am not sure where to go this time. Of course I love camping but I think it's probably still too cold for that so I am content with just walking around and taking some photos. I thought about flying up to Ketchikan from Seattle and heading over to Sitka but it seems those towns are big for cruises and the last thing I want is being around mobs of cruisers. Are these two towns easily walkable without needing a car?

Nome seems like an interesting city. Would that be worth visiting for a few days?

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic.

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that.

Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,worried","Family member hiking from Bethel, has hypothermia, rescue unavailable due to high winds","Basically title - a cousin of mine (who has lived in Alaska previously several times) was starting a hike from Bethel, Alaska today towards the Yukon River. They are wearing a tracker. They are about thirteen miles out from Bethel, in the swamplands, and developing hypothermia. Per texts from their immediate family, due to the high winds today, rescuers cannot reach them. I am states away and feeling really helpless and powerless. 

No other family members are in Alaska at this time. Does Bethel have any other options for rescue besides air rescue? Will they/can they hike after him or send rescue dogs? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Please be kind, I don’t know much about Alaska. Thank you.  

Edit: Just heard from them directly. They’re hiking back, hypothermia symptoms are mild right now and they know how to handle the symptoms. The way others were wording it, it came across as if they were dying in a ditch somewhere, so I’m relieved to hear the situation is not that serious. Thank you for all the suggestions. 

Edit 2: He’s still wet and cold and exhausted, but does not want to ask for help or press his panic button. He started hiking back but it took him two days to go the 13 miles and now he’s not feeling well so instead he’s hunkered down for the night. I’m worried for him but we’ll see what happens. 

Final Edit: he was rescued & hospitalized but is safe and is going to be okay. Thanks to the people on this post, your suggestions and phone numbers helped us get him help in time. I really appreciate all of the helpful people on here! ",2024-07-26 14:18:52

However, I also know how intense winter is over there so I’m hoping to get some advice on when would be the best time to go/how bad of an idea it would be to start my contract sometime in mid/late February.

Some context: I am from New England so I’m no stranger to cold weather in the winter and the contracts I’m looking at would provide me with housing so i wouldn’t have to worry about that. I was also planning on leasing a car once I get there.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,worried","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,relieved","Family member hiking from Bethel, has hypothermia, rescue unavailable due to high winds","Basically title - a cousin of mine (who has lived in Alaska previously several times) was starting a hike from Bethel, Alaska today towards the Yukon River. They are wearing a tracker. They are about thirteen miles out from Bethel, in the swamplands, and developing hypothermia. Per texts from their immediate family, due to the high winds today, rescuers cannot reach them. I am states away and feeling really helpless and powerless. 

No other family members are in Alaska at this time. Does Bethel have any other options for rescue besides air rescue? Will they/can they hike after him or send rescue dogs? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Please be kind, I don’t know much about Alaska. Thank you.  

Edit: Just heard from them directly. They’re hiking back, hypothermia symptoms are mild right now and they know how to handle the symptoms. The way others were wording it, it came across as if they were dying in a ditch somewhere, so I’m relieved to hear the situation is not that serious. Thank you for all the suggestions. 

Edit 2: He’s still wet and cold and exhausted, but does not want to ask for help or press his panic button. He started hiking back but it took him two days to go the 13 miles and now he’s not feeling well so instead he’s hunkered down for the night. I’m worried for him but we’ll see what happens. 

Final Edit: he was rescued & hospitalized but is safe and is going to be okay. Thanks to the people on this post, your suggestions and phone numbers helped us get him help in time. I really appreciate all of the helpful people on here! ",2024-07-26 14:18:52
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,scared",How important is a down coat?,"I just moved up here and I brought one of my winter coats, it's polyester, with a sherpa lining, and 130 g of polyfill insulation. 

I'm looking at downcoats right now, I was told there is a big difference in warmth and that down should be bought for the winter. 

I'm looking at two pieces right now, they have different down to waterfowl feathers ratios, for one is pretty much all down, and one is half and half. I have no clue what this means, or if it's that big of a difference to my old coat. 

If anyone could let me know anything about coats I'd really appreciate it! A bit scared for the winter, and I run cold. I already got rabbit fur Italian leather gloves (I don't like wool touching my hands) and thick alpaca socks.",2024-10-01 03:55:00

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,scared",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,scared",Interested in Moving,"Hi!!! I’m interested in moving to Alaska. Let me tell you about myself so you can give me some recommendations. I HATE the cold, it makes me feel so sad and shivery. I also don’t like snow, however I can tolerate it when it is still in the liquid form. All that aside, let me tell you about my favorite hobbies!! I hate skiing, sledding, snowboarding, fishing, Ice fishing, hiking, driving in any condition other than plain concrete, and bending over too much. It hurts my wee little back. On the contrary, I love tanning, surfing, scuba diving, dancing, and parasailing. Let me talk about my fears. Bears are so scary!!! Luckily there are none here right! 😁 Mosquitos scare me too, and so does the dark. Me and my family were looking at Utqiagvik, as i’m sure it has all my likings. What do you think? Thanks for the feedback! 
Hasta la vista!!",2023-12-25 21:52:53
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,scared",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,excited","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,excited","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,excited",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"cold,excited",Any advice or tips for someone moving to Alaska?,"My family is PCSing to Anchorage in a few weeks and we will be stationed there until 2027. We have never been to Alaska before and are inexperienced with cold weather (😂). 

I’m not sure what to expect with this change of location and lifestyle. We are coming from California. So, we are used to the stereotypical CA weather, going to beach every day, insanely high cost of living/gas/taxes/etc. 

I have gotten feedback from other military families that are/were stationed in Anchorage, but their feedback of course is coming from a military spouse/service member perspective. 

What are some things we should know about prior to arriving? We are extremely excited to embrace the beauty and lifestyle change that is sure to come with moving to Alaska vs California. What are we in for?",2023-07-13 04:46:26
Alaska,BOTH,"cold,excited",How do we pack/dress/travel for December weather in a glass igloo?,"We are traveling to Alaska this Dec for 4 days to stay in the glass igloos and see the aurora! I can’t be more excited! Except for the fact that I was born and raised in the desert and I’m still always cold. I’ve literally never been in more than 4 in of snow and I’ve never been in colder than 20 degree weather. I have NO IDEA how to dress for such cold weather. I’m also unlikely to wear most of it more than 5x over the next 20 years so I don’t want to drop a fortune. But I also don’t want to be cold. Eek! I’ve tried googling but I’m super overwhelmed by options, brands, and opinions. Can you help me simplify this? 

- What do I def need? 
- What is worth investing in versus renting? (For instance they offer overboots to rent. Is that a good option or too cold to wear over some basic winter boots?)
- What brands are warm enough and decent quality but still budget friendly? 
- Any other tips to help a desert rat to survive the cold?

Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

I don’t plan on going into “homeless” camps. I have “regulars” I see on my patrols that sleep in doorways and cars. These are the people I’d like to help immediately. I feel terrible asking individuals to leave back into the cold. 

I think a cup of soup would be nice. I could carry a thermos of hot water to make it on the spot. Hand warmers and feet warmers would probably make a good gift as well. ",2024-11-10 07:50:17
Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",How to walk in Anchorage without freezing to death? No car.,"Hello this december I will be in Anchorage for this winter. 

I am wondering how tu survive without car. My friends can give me a ride to go groceries or some important places. But I don't want to abuse. However they are very nice and kind. 

Be a pedestrian in Anchorage was all an adventure this summer and I imagine that this winter will be a horror with inches and inches of snow. I am afraid I don't want to freezing to death waiting People Mover (Bus) or walking for example 15 or 30 minutes. Or fall on the slippery floor.

I was two times in Alaska. This summer and last march.  I am from European Union. We went to walk all places and the distances are more short. 

People recommended don't bring snow clothes from my country and get in Alaska. I will take the minimous to be warm. T-shirts and thermal pants. And I will dress in layers like an onion.

I hope that somebody can help me with his/her wise. 

Thanks for all. ",2023-11-22 10:57:16
Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Cold weather photographers? (a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24
Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Anyone here lived in a camper year round?,"Got a job that pays enough for me to start considering a house in ~2 years, but I'm tired of living in apartments and I'm now looking at options. If I get a camper the monthly on it + a lot rental should be cheaper than a one bed apartment but I'm a little worried about stuff like plumbing freezing over the winters and clearing the snow off the roof.

I would be looking at newer campers, probably in the 20-30k range.

Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Water Collection Systems in Winter,"I am interested in making my home more energy independent. I am on a private well with septic. I would like to know if it would be worth installing a rain collection system.

For those who collect rainwater, how do you use it and what does your system look like?

Is it possible to prevent the water from freezing if it is insulated above ground? Not really interested in below ground water canisters. Do you rely on summer rain for your water in the winter?",2024-07-29 22:41:44
Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?  Specifically Anchorage, but maybe Fairbanks, which I gather means a few tens of degrees colder...

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Thanks in advance, I look forward to hearing y'all's suggestions!",2024-01-10 23:10:52
Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14
Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37
Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,like",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"freezing,worried",Best layers and sleeping bag for end of June outside Anchorage?,"My teen is spending a week camping with a guide/ group of other teens at the end of June and I'm just trying to get recommendations for what layers are most comfortable for the swing in temps and mosquitoes? They'll be a couple hours outside of Anchorage, and they're doing the typical outdoorsy activities, a smaller hike, group team building we might expect to see for a teen summer trip. He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm. We do need to be budget conscious, he's on scholarship we aren't ""just"" putting him on a plane to Alaska for a week lol, but I'm also not worried about whether we'll ever use the gear again, my 12 yo goes camping with scouts frequently so things will get used. Thank you.",2024-05-01 05:23:12
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",I have a bit of a strange request,"Alright so I’m in the process of working on a horror novel taking place in Alaska. I’m Canadian, from British Columbia, and love traveling to your beautiful state - I’ve been in and around Anchorage, visited Denali, Seward, Homer and Valdez. Have hiked and kayaked around the mountains and the ocean. I love the rugged vastness and epic scale of the state and it really reminds me a lot of my home province. I’ve also always felt that its isolation and untouched nature makes it ripe for a setting of a horror story.

I’m looking to set my story in a small coastal town, and I’m looking for some real-life examples in the state that I can base it on, to make it feel as real and grounded as possible. It won’t be 1:1 obviously and I’ll change names and features around but I’ll use this town(s) as a template. In terms of features - I’m looking for a town/village/hamlet with a population of 1500 or under (could be as low as 50 even), of a coastal nature, so situated right on the water, surrounded by mountains and forests, and fairly difficult to get to. It could be a very long drive or maybe you need to take a ferry to get there. The main character is an outsider who moves to this town for work and encounters all sorts of spooky occurrences. 

Is there anything like the town that I’m looking for? Through some initial research, some of the places I’ve found that match are Craig, Hoonah, Gustavus, Perryville and Wrangell (above the population cutoff but matches some other factors). Any others? Maybe some remote, fly-in villages?

EDIT: thanks so much for your help everyone. I’ve decided to go with a fictional coastal town that’s a combination of Whittier and Seldovia as these two stood out the most to me.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Rentals are getting out of hand in Anchorage,"I feel there needs to be regulation on rental prices. Having to pay a median price of $1850 for a 2 bedroom is blowing my mind

Median income/person is $39k roughly  $36k after taxes.

People are paying 60 percent of there income on housing alone.

I propose a monthly % cap based on the land lord's monthly mortgage rate that can be added to the rent to cover the mortgage and expenses for repairs and some pocket change

Let's say a landlord owns a duplex townhouse at 880,000 with a 30year mortgage rate. Monthly they pay roughly $2,444. Split between two renters to cover the cost

Each house hold would pay 1,222.

Let's say there was a 10% monthly mortgage rate cap that can be added to each renters base rent. Making rent 1450

1450 would be still pretty high for the average person sitting at 48% of income. But definitely a better option then having to pay price gouged rental prices of 1850

TLDR: Rent is way to high, cost of living is rising and the main factor of this is housing. I propose regulation on rentals, or have our mayor look into this housing crisis.

Edit: I would love critism or suggestions to help fix this issue, just feel like exploiting the market due to lack of rental properties is terrible way to go about life in general

Edit #2: I don't condone threats against landlords just want them to be reasonable and for us to collaborate and possibly make a change, 

Tbh I don't think milking money off of rentals is a sustainable way of living, a smart investor knows this is passive income. With the return of  price of the property when you sell. 

When markets squeeze the people that are living in your rentals maybe be a tad more considerate cause even though we all feel the inflation ""the landlords"" and people with flexible money don't have it nearly as bad as us

Edit #3: reading through all these comments is very constructive and really is lighting fire in me to look more into this. 

I'll reach out to the governor,state representative and our mayor for possible insight and potential future changes they might apply.",2023-06-15 00:28:55

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Question for hunters/firearm people,"I am headed up to Alaska in June for me and my fiancee to get married. We're planning on doing it out in the wilderness probably up near Hatcher's pass. I'm trying to, amidst the details of planning all of the logistics, balance what I'm hearing as conflicting 'advice' or 'true stories' about being out in the wilderness around there with a group of people for several hours. 

I have a non zero number of people telling me that I should probably have a firearm with me in case wildlife decides to party crash. I also have a non zero number of people telling me that its more likely for me to get mugged at the gas station here in Houston than for anything with teeth to come towards a group of people out there. 

I'm trying to get more of a sense of reality from people there, and with first hand experience. I'm leaning towards not really needing one, and I don't particularly want to have to schlep something up with me and then mail it back (going on a cruise right after), just for a 0.0000001% chance. Not only are the logistics annoying, but my (soon to be) wife isn't a super fan of the idea (or even that I ccw daily anyway), and everyone attending is pretty much anti-gun other than me.

IF I should, and ultimately did however, would a .460 Rowland chambered G21 be sufficient to dissuade anything from treating us like a buffet?

TL;DR= Getting married in June @ Hatcher's pass. Should I have a bear/other gun with me if we're going to be out in the mountains for several hours?

This would not be my first gun, and in fact it's one I already have, have shot with, and have trained with and run competitions with.

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

In Anchorage, his 40-day celebration was just as well-attended. Buzzy was someone who made an impression on everyone he met — and it seems like he had truly met everyone! The amount of wonderful stories I’ve heard from Alaskans about their experiences with him have helped me to see the love that he inspired in the world, and that has been truly healing for me.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",How realistic is a 1-2 month car camping trip in Alaska? Cost range?,"I'm wondering if this is a possible option considering climate and enviorment of Alaska, and the cost (mostly for food). 

I would like to sleep in my car for 1-2 months (i have experience car camping) and just spend the time exploring Alaska and the national parks. 

I always hear Alaska is a expensive place to travel, but i want to know if thats for people who are lounging and if car camping would significantly decrease the cost. 

Also if you have other recomendations for places I could visit that I could also get to experience this that is more managable than alaska, I'd love to hear that",2024-03-07 23:20:45
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Managing expectations about moving to Alaska,"Hello everyone! I looked through a bunch of posts about moving to Alaska, but I do still have some some questions to make sure it'd be the right choice for my family.

Specifically, we'd be looking at Anchorage, Kodiak, Juneau, Valdez, or maybe Bethel (less likely though.) I'd be working in the power industry, so not too worried about job prospects 

For context, we're considering Alaska for these primary reasons: we love the outdoors, want to have a small homestead, and we want to be around a like minded community that enjoys the same lifestyle. Plus I'd love to work for a company that helps with rural electrification/renewable energy like AVEC or any of the other power coops.

These are my thoughts/questions:

We'd like to visit Anchorage during the ""worst"" time in Alaska for at least a week to see if we can handle the low temp/long nights. Is that like Dec-Jan? Are there any reasons that's a bad idea?

Ive heard cost of living is high and seen stuff like $10 gallons of milk or $45 two-packs of olive oil. Are the groceries just high across the board or could some of the cost be mitigated with lifestyle changes?

We'd like about 2 acres to have goats, chickens, etc. to help with food costs and be more self sufficient. Anybody have experience with that and if it actually helps? Are there other options for cheaper but healthy food?

Housing/acreage seemed surprisingly sparse. Call me silly, but I would have thought there would be more options available. Is the current market pretty standard or is it just a bad time to look. (Perhaps more listings in the summer?)

Any other info for the areas I mentioned that someone from the lower 48 should know before moving up? Any help is appreciated!",2023-02-01 05:21:25

Coming to Alaska and I might want to get myself a totem and maybe some other goodies, but I was wondering if there were things that people up there would love to pickup? I know the internet has changed this for the most part, but thinking when I went to Hawaii (post internet),I brought Dr Pepper, Twinkies, ding dongs and I even brought some blue jeans to a friend of mine. He mentioned that if I packed a suitcase full of that stuff, that other people would be interested. I did it and the stuff didn't last 20 minutes some of the neighbors and passerbys cleaned me out.
 
At first it seemed a little weird, but I've done this in different states and countries. Not that I'm going to sit there and pack an entire suitcase full of Twinkies and ding dongs, but I thought it'd be nice to bring a couple of items. (Even as tip or a little thank you). I grew up in a relatively isolated area so I know what it's like trying to get stuff imported. This time's a little weird because I don't know anybody that lives there, but, in the past I've always had good luck with making a deal and/or making someone's day.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",5 Days in Kenai Peninsula ,"Hello all, my girlfriend and I are super excited to be visiting Alaska for the first time in July. We already have our rental car booked. I was looking to get some recommendations for our 5 full days there. We love nature, culture, hiking, music, and food. Taking everyone's advice for our time restrictions, we will only be doing the Kenai Peninsula this time around.

Days 1-3: On our first full day we will be driving down to Seward in the morning from Anchorage. We currently have the first two nights booked in Seward where we are wanting to do a glacier cruise and some kayaking. Any recommendations on companies would be much appreciated. 

Days 3-5: We then spend the next two nights in Homer. Any recommendations on things to do there would be great. However, I'm wondering if 2 nights in Homer is too much... We definitely want to explore the town but I'm thinking maybe doing one night would be enough? I wonder if spending the other night in Soldotna or Coopers Landing would be better, maybe book a rafting trip down the river or spend a half a day fishing for trout or salmon.  What do you all think?

Days 5-6: The last night we'll stay in Anchorage and spend the morning exploring Anchorage before catching our afternoon flight home. 

Let me know what you guys think, definitely open to changes.",2024-05-21 13:51:48

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

I probably have more which I may add on later, but these are my main concerns. I'd like to save up some money to fund a move from AZ to MN, so that is also something I am thinking about.

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,hate",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

“We still have a long way to go. We don't want to go backwards,” Leavitt said.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,hate",I put together an overview of Project Willow and what both sides are saying,"The Biden administration has approved a modified version of the Willow Master Development Plan in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The approval allows ConocoPhillips to proceed with the project with a reduction from five to three drill sites and the relinquishment of 68,000 acres of current leases. [U.S. Department of the Interior](https://doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-substantially-reduces-scope-willow-project)

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

**Key Facts:**

* “The project could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the company — about 1.5% of total U.S. oil production.

* “The Willow project is a roughly $7 billion proposal from ConocoPhillips to drill oil and gas in Alaska. It would be located inside the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a 23 million-acre (93 million-hectare) area on the state’s North Slope that is the largest tract of undisturbed public land in the United States.” [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/willow-oil-gas-project-alaska-sparks-green-opposition-2023-03-03/)
* “According to environmental impact statements published by the federal government, if the oil produced by Willow is burned, it would create 260 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.” [Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2023/02/21/alaska-house-votes-unanimously-to-support-willow-oil-project/)

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,enjoy","Relocating from Columbus, OH to Alaska","Hi, I'm just looking for advice/warnings/whatever you want to say about my situation. I F22 and my partner M27 have an opportunity to move from a town outside Columbus, OH to Alaska next year. The town we live in now has a population of about 40,000. I am a med lab tech and have been approached by SEARHC about relocating to either Juneau, Wrangell, or Sitka. Juneau is our first choice since it's the biggest and closest to what we are familiar with coming from a city. I have lived in rural areas for most of my life and we're both introverts but we enjoy outdoor activities as well (fishing, hiking. He likes to kayak but I've never gone). I know it would be a radical change but I want to explore the world and this seems like a opportunity to live somewhere new for a few years and it doesn't hurt that the move would be partially paid for. 

We've been doing a lot of research but I would like to hear from some locals about advice for housing, moving, and just life in AK in general. Also important to note, we have one 20 lb dog and a cat who would be coming with.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,enjoy",Managing expectations about moving to Alaska,"Hello everyone! I looked through a bunch of posts about moving to Alaska, but I do still have some some questions to make sure it'd be the right choice for my family.

Specifically, we'd be looking at Anchorage, Kodiak, Juneau, Valdez, or maybe Bethel (less likely though.) I'd be working in the power industry, so not too worried about job prospects 

For context, we're considering Alaska for these primary reasons: we love the outdoors, want to have a small homestead, and we want to be around a like minded community that enjoys the same lifestyle. Plus I'd love to work for a company that helps with rural electrification/renewable energy like AVEC or any of the other power coops.

These are my thoughts/questions:

We'd like to visit Anchorage during the ""worst"" time in Alaska for at least a week to see if we can handle the low temp/long nights. Is that like Dec-Jan? Are there any reasons that's a bad idea?

Ive heard cost of living is high and seen stuff like $10 gallons of milk or $45 two-packs of olive oil. Are the groceries just high across the board or could some of the cost be mitigated with lifestyle changes?

We'd like about 2 acres to have goats, chickens, etc. to help with food costs and be more self sufficient. Anybody have experience with that and if it actually helps? Are there other options for cheaper but healthy food?

Housing/acreage seemed surprisingly sparse. Call me silly, but I would have thought there would be more options available. Is the current market pretty standard or is it just a bad time to look. (Perhaps more listings in the summer?)

Any other info for the areas I mentioned that someone from the lower 48 should know before moving up? Any help is appreciated!",2023-02-01 05:21:25

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,enjoy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,enjoy",Need help for a documentary ,"Hello! I am doing some research for an upcoming documentary on the visible effects of climate change in alaska. What I ask of this subreddit is help finding locations for the visual content of the documentary. More specifically, I am looking for locations along the dalton highway and northern slopes that exemplify permafrost degradation. I am looking for drunken forests, high wildlife areas, and anything visually interesting, particularly if it has relevance to the changing landscape.

The documentary will be following a multi week schedule in which my team will be driving from fairbanks to deadhorse via the dalton highway. If there are any locations along this route that folks know of, I would greatly appreciate the help so that I may begin to create a more detailed and specific itinerary. Thanks!",2024-06-25 02:21:34
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,enjoy",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

Please let me know if this type of post is not welcome on the main page and I'll be happy to re-post in the correct space. I \[27M\] will be visiting Alaska (from Cali) with my parents \[55+\] in late August for 8 full days of activity. It will be our first time there, and so would love to hear some feedback on the current schedule I have laid out! We do have a rental car for the entire duration, and our main focus is to see wildlife, spectacular views, and bonus points if anyone has running trails for myself you'd recommend. Overall, we're still fine-tuning a lot of the finer details such as exact hikes, etc and it seems like we still have a few days where we need to find things to do or are subject to change as we continue fine-tuning the details (such as Day 2/4/7/8). Overall, I'd just like to take any tips or suggestions, and get anyone's take on whether this itinerary seems ambitious, about right, or a bit too little. Any Advice is appreciated, thank you & we're really looking forward to seeing this beautiful state! :) 

Day 1: \[Anchorage to Talkeetna\] Arrive at Anchorage 1am, resting at the airport until car pickup at 5:30am - head into town and grab some breakfast / figure out what to do/see either in Anchorage or nearby. We're open to unique museums, but are pretty well-travelled from an urban perspective. Potentially visit Powerline Pass Trail and hike an hour or two out and back! Drive up to Talkeetna around 11am, lunch at Denali Brewing, walk around and enjoy the small town until End of Day. Another option would be to go straight to Talkeetna and try squeezing in a flight-seeing event. Seems pretty popular but have never done smth like that before...is this activity worth the cost?   


Day 2: \[Talkeetna to Denali\] Leave \~8/9am to Denali. Spend a half day at the park before retiring to the nearby Cabin we have booked. 

&#x200B;

Day 3: \[Denali\] Full day in the park! Miscellaneous hikes/viewpoints/etc. Hoping to do a trail run if there are any recommended. Thinking we do the regular busses for easy on/off access instead of a green tour bus, but open to change!  

&#x200B;

 Day 4: \[Denali to Anchorage\] Transit Day, if there is anything we missed in the parks, don't mind spending 70% of the day back in the park. Drive down to Anchorage & rest after. 

&#x200B;

Day 5: \[Anchorage to Seward\] Leave \~8am: Stop at Girdwood for the Alyeska Tram/Mountain (potential trail run up?) & check out the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center. Random scenic stops along the way to Seward. Relax upon arrival.   


Day 6: \[Kenai Fjords\] - Full Marine Major 8.5 hour boat tour of the park.

&#x200B;

Day 7: \[Kenai Fjords to Anchorage\] - 9/10am: Harding Icefield Trail! I would like to do this full 9.2 mile hike (if it's decently runnable, I can wrap it up within 2-2.5 hours). Parents will do part of the beginning & some easy connecting trails from the parking lot. Grab lunch somewhere and drive back up to Anchorage. 

Day 8: Relax in Anchorage - need to find stuff to do. Get to Airport at 10:00pm.",2023-06-15 15:54:39

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

“We still have a long way to go. We don't want to go backwards,” Leavitt said.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,dislike",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,dislike","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,dislike",Need help for a documentary ,"Hello! I am doing some research for an upcoming documentary on the visible effects of climate change in alaska. What I ask of this subreddit is help finding locations for the visual content of the documentary. More specifically, I am looking for locations along the dalton highway and northern slopes that exemplify permafrost degradation. I am looking for drunken forests, high wildlife areas, and anything visually interesting, particularly if it has relevance to the changing landscape.

The documentary will be following a multi week schedule in which my team will be driving from fairbanks to deadhorse via the dalton highway. If there are any locations along this route that folks know of, I would greatly appreciate the help so that I may begin to create a more detailed and specific itinerary. Thanks!",2024-06-25 02:21:34
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,dislike",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

-it causes emotional, mental, and I'd argue spiritual distress to Natives, and those all cause physical problems, it is unhealthy for Natives to deal with it any time we interact here.

-it discourages Natives from even posting here, which...

-decreases diversity and inclusion, which allows harm in real life to continue and grow as folks remain ignorant without being exposed to our issues, viewpoints, and cultures.

-and it will ultimately make our community, here and other places, worse off.

I see the works the mods are doing, and it's good, and I'm sure they're also stressed by dealing with it. But given how rampant it is, I feel as if more can and should be done.

So, I'd like to ask folks what we can do in thos subreddit to make it as welcoming as possible for all people who live in Alaska.

-what changes can the mods make?
-what can us redditors do to help?
-what kind of content should be shared more often to help educate and bring awareness?

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like",Alaska isn't a conservative state. So let's not vote that way.,"Alaska isn't a conservative state. A whopping 58.6% of us are (U)ndeclared and (N)on-Partisan voters. Only 12.4% of Alaskan voters are Democrats and only 23.8% are Republicans.

[src: https:\/\/www.elections.alaska.gov\/research\/statistics\/](https://preview.redd.it/cxmbkwrfp7pc1.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0b3385936e9ba4d4dd5654311301fef8f2863d6)

The old election system with closed primaries certainly helped the Republicans stay in control. A small group of party leaders could essentially dictate which candidates made it to the general election and if you stepped out of line, that was it. Game over.

I think parties are still coasting on that old power but it's starting to burn off since we changed to Ranked Choice Voting and open primaries.

The veto override vote today was disheartening but it also showed how little unity exists in the Alaska Republican Party right now. Out of 33 Republicans in the legislature, only 20 supported Governor Dunleavy. They're not exactly marching in lockstep.

This recent polling by Data for Progress was quite interesting as well. It points to Alaskans being overwhelmingly in favor of progressive policies -- things like a very large BSA increase, child care subsidies and other social programs, etc -- and despite all that, there's a preference for the worst of the worst conservative candidates amongst the same sample group.

It's like we're not quite connecting policy to people. Hopefully we can do a little better in the next election cycle.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like",I’m homeless and losing hope ,"I recently moved from wasilla to anchorage after falling on hard times and becoming homeless about 2 months ago. My girlfriend and I are both living in my tiny ford focus and it’s been rough.

I’ve had a hard past and had made some mistakes but am now on the straight and narrow. Neither of us use drugs and we both got full time jobs less than a week after moving here. We work retail and have managed to save around $2000 and are currently looking for housing. I’m contemplating staying at a shitty motel since I’ve been wasting money on application fees on apartments. I’ve applied for 5 now and have been turned down each time due to my record. No felonies but theres been some mistakes.

Ive changed since then and learned from my mistakes. I’m a good person, I try to do good and help those around me and stay far away from trouble now. I have no family or friends out here and I’m starting to lose hope. Maybe I’m just destined to live like this forever and it won’t get better.  I feel like anybody should get a second chance and I feel like I’ve been making all the right and healthy decisions lately but it’s hard to stay positive.

I just reaching out in case anyone knows of any housing or any communities that could help us. We have food stamps and our work is letting us stay in the parking lot to sleep. We use the food pantry to get food every now and then. I just want a roof over my head before it gets too cold. I’m tired of feeling judged and looked down upon or like I’m a drug addict because I’ve fallen on hard times. Being homeless is not easy. Constantly trying to find time to shower and what to eat, or where to sleep, wondering if I’ll ever be able to find housing, staying warm. Our eating habits are terrible right now. No hot food except fast food and it’s destroying my stomach. And working 40+ hours a week at a shitty retail store on top of that with no bed to come home to.

I hope all of my hard work pays off soon because I’m starting to lose hope. If anyone could help or give me any advice I’d be grateful. Peace ✌️",2024-09-08 06:52:12

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like",I have a bit of a strange request,"Alright so I’m in the process of working on a horror novel taking place in Alaska. I’m Canadian, from British Columbia, and love traveling to your beautiful state - I’ve been in and around Anchorage, visited Denali, Seward, Homer and Valdez. Have hiked and kayaked around the mountains and the ocean. I love the rugged vastness and epic scale of the state and it really reminds me a lot of my home province. I’ve also always felt that its isolation and untouched nature makes it ripe for a setting of a horror story.

I’m looking to set my story in a small coastal town, and I’m looking for some real-life examples in the state that I can base it on, to make it feel as real and grounded as possible. It won’t be 1:1 obviously and I’ll change names and features around but I’ll use this town(s) as a template. In terms of features - I’m looking for a town/village/hamlet with a population of 1500 or under (could be as low as 50 even), of a coastal nature, so situated right on the water, surrounded by mountains and forests, and fairly difficult to get to. It could be a very long drive or maybe you need to take a ferry to get there. The main character is an outsider who moves to this town for work and encounters all sorts of spooky occurrences. 

Is there anything like the town that I’m looking for? Through some initial research, some of the places I’ve found that match are Craig, Hoonah, Gustavus, Perryville and Wrangell (above the population cutoff but matches some other factors). Any others? Maybe some remote, fly-in villages?

EDIT: thanks so much for your help everyone. I’ve decided to go with a fictional coastal town that’s a combination of Whittier and Seldovia as these two stood out the most to me.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like",We will go dark on June 12th in protest of Reddit's API changes that will effectively kill 3rd party apps,"Dear r/Alaska Community,

​

today, we want to discuss an urgent matter that affects both the moderators and users. As you may be aware, [the recent announcement made by Reddit](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/popular-reddit-app-apollo-may-go-out-of-business-over-reddits-new-unaffordable-api-pricing/) regarding their APIs have raised significant concerns within the Reddit community.

​

Starting on July 1st, Reddit has unilaterally decided to impose exorbitant charges on third-party app developers(Relay, Reddit is Fun, Apollo, Baconreader, Narwhal etc.) for utilizing their API. This decision [has far-reaching consequences that not only hinder app developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) but also affect the experience of moderators and users alike. The lack of maturity in Reddit's official app has made it difficult for us to fulfill our responsibilities as moderators efficiently, and it has also left many users dissatisfied with their browsing experience.

​

In response to this situation, the moderators of r/Alaska have joined forces with other subreddit communities and their respective mod teams in a coordinated effort. We believe that unity is essential in driving change and advocating for the rights of app developers and the overall user experience. To amplify our message and demonstrate the strength of our concerns, r/Alaska will be participating in a temporary blackout starting on June 12th, lasting for 48 hours.

​

During this blackout period, the subreddit will be set to private, rendering it inaccessible to all users. This collective action is intended to raise awareness and urge Reddit to reconsider their recent API changes. Our primary goal is to initiate a productive dialogue with Reddit, leading to a reversal of the detrimental modifications they have implemented.

​

We understand that this blackout may cause temporary inconvenience to our community, and for that, we apologize. However, we firmly believe that this short-term disruption will bring long-term benefits for every user. By standing together with other subreddit communities, we hope to send a clear message to Reddit and foster a meaningful conversation about the future of their API policies.

​

In the meantime, we encourage you to let reddit know that you disagree with their planned changes

​

There are a few ways you can express your concerns:

​

* [Email](mailto:contact@reddit.com) Reddit or [create a support ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to communicate your opposition to their proposed modifications.

​

* Share your thoughts on other social media platforms, spreading awareness about the issue.

​

* Show your support by participating in the Reddit boycott for 48 hours, starting on June 12th.

​

We appreciate your understanding, support, and active participation in this important endeavor. It is through the strength and dedication of our community that we can strive for a better Reddit experience for everyone involved.

​

Thank you,

The Mod Team of r/Alaska

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,like",Fairbanks Animal Shelter has so many dogs for adoption!! 🐕🦮🐩🐕‍🦺,"“The Fairbanks North Star Borough Animal Shelter is at capacity for dogs, with limited options for those that can’t be adopted out quickly.

Earlier this week, a chorus of barks and cries coming from dogs looking for new homes filled the shelter’s kennel rooms. The facility is seeing at least twice as many dogs being dropped off as adopted out, said shelter operations supervisor Kimberly Imbert.

“Because people have job changes. They have unforeseen lifestyle changes. Those are the two big reasons that we’re seeing dogs coming in,” she said.

Imbert said the situation is unusual but in line with a national trend. She said the number of dogs surrendered at the borough shelter currently exceeds the indoor kennel capacity allotted for them.

“We pick the number 26 because that leaves enough open kennels so that we can take in strays, and we have 40 dogs indoors right now, so we are completely full,” she said.

The shelter also has a fenced outdoor area with dog houses and tethers, but Imbert said for safety reasons that’s only for dogs accustomed to being tied out. She said when capacity is tight the shelter has to make tough decisions about which dogs are more likely to be adopted.

“We have to look at their health, if they are spayed and neutered and their temperament,” she said. “And then when we are this full, there’s only a certain amount of surgeries that can generally be done in a day by our shelter veterinarian, so then we’re looking at who our fast-track adoption candidates, because if we can get those spayed and neutered first, they can move out of here quicker.”

Imbert said the shelter aims to find homes for all the dogs and there’s also the possibility of transfer to an animal rescue group or finding a foster home, but a grim reality comes into play.

“Euthanasia is the most efficient way to make space, because putting a dog in foster takes time and if one dog comes in we can take that time,” she said. “If five dogs come in, we’re in a bind.”

Imbert encouraged people to try the borough’s online “Home to Home” platform to re-home their dogs before bringing them to the shelter.

“Ideally you would plan ahead and try to re-home your animal yourself, because we only want to be here for the animals that truly, truly need us,” she said.

She also noted that adoption rates at the shelter fluctuate and she’s optimistic that they will pick up, emphasizing that the process is fairly simple, and starts with making an appointment.

“But we do accept walk-ins when there’s availability, so you come in, you visit with the animals, the care staff goes over everything we know about the animal, and we go over any care instructions that we have,” she said. “If they’ve just had spay or neuter surgery, they may need special care for two weeks. And then, at that point, if you decide to adopt the animal, you go to the front desk, you show them your ID, pay the adoption fee, sign an agreement and you go home with your animal.”

Imbert said the shelter is offering half-off adoption fees for all animals this week.”

The recent education bill (SB 140) passed the legislature by a vote of 56-3 and included critical funding for the many Alaska school districts which are running multi-million dollar deficits. This is primarily due to years of flat funding as inflation drove up costs.

It was a good compromise bill and Dunleavy blew it all up because he had a couple poorly vetted ideas that didn't get in the mix. Nothing more dangerous than a big weird boss with an ego I guess.

Part of the problem... It's us Alaskans. We voted for this guy. I mean, not me and hopefully not you, but some of did.

It was a shock to see him win another four years after a massive statewide recall effort. We hit a wall with covid and couldn't gather enough signatures in time but I thought voters would at least remember the chaos he introduced in 2019. I guess not.

We have a small world up here and I think it's necessary to forget and forgive sometimes so we can get along with our neighbors who annoy us. We learn to live with each other. It's a good skill. Until it's not.

So what do we do now? I don't think another recall is the answer here. It was hard work. It takes too long and costs too much. I suppose if you want to kick in a couple million to fund it, I might change my mind. But the people who carried that effort put in their hours already and it seems a steep ask to rekindle it.

BUT we have legislative elections on the horizon and that's where we can most immediately make our voices heard. There are stooges and lackeys for this governor in the legislature and we need to let them know we see them. We need to pay attention on Monday to whoever refuses to override this veto. And those legislators need to go.

At least that's what I think needs to happen.",2024-03-15 06:46:06
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoying",Question for hunters/firearm people,"I am headed up to Alaska in June for me and my fiancee to get married. We're planning on doing it out in the wilderness probably up near Hatcher's pass. I'm trying to, amidst the details of planning all of the logistics, balance what I'm hearing as conflicting 'advice' or 'true stories' about being out in the wilderness around there with a group of people for several hours. 

I have a non zero number of people telling me that I should probably have a firearm with me in case wildlife decides to party crash. I also have a non zero number of people telling me that its more likely for me to get mugged at the gas station here in Houston than for anything with teeth to come towards a group of people out there. 

I'm trying to get more of a sense of reality from people there, and with first hand experience. I'm leaning towards not really needing one, and I don't particularly want to have to schlep something up with me and then mail it back (going on a cruise right after), just for a 0.0000001% chance. Not only are the logistics annoying, but my (soon to be) wife isn't a super fan of the idea (or even that I ccw daily anyway), and everyone attending is pretty much anti-gun other than me.

IF I should, and ultimately did however, would a .460 Rowland chambered G21 be sufficient to dissuade anything from treating us like a buffet?

TL;DR= Getting married in June @ Hatcher's pass. Should I have a bear/other gun with me if we're going to be out in the mountains for several hours?

EDIT: Super active discussion, with a lot of good advice, and yet someone is still downloading the s*** out of it? Love ya reddit, never change.

EDIT 2: Maybe I needed to say this clearly, but I guess I didn't - I am not buying a gun, just go up to a 5 hour wedding in Alaska. This would not be my first gun, and in fact it's one I already have, have shot with, and have trained with and run competitions with. This was a question about risk vs logistical pain in the ass - not someone looking for 'an excuse to buy a gun and go shoot things in Alaska'. I thank you all for the concern for everyone's safety, that was the whole point of this thread... from wildlife, not me and a firearm.",2023-02-18 23:35:30

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoying","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoying",Need help for a documentary ,"Hello! I am doing some research for an upcoming documentary on the visible effects of climate change in alaska. What I ask of this subreddit is help finding locations for the visual content of the documentary. More specifically, I am looking for locations along the dalton highway and northern slopes that exemplify permafrost degradation. I am looking for drunken forests, high wildlife areas, and anything visually interesting, particularly if it has relevance to the changing landscape.

The documentary will be following a multi week schedule in which my team will be driving from fairbanks to deadhorse via the dalton highway. If there are any locations along this route that folks know of, I would greatly appreciate the help so that I may begin to create a more detailed and specific itinerary. Thanks!",2024-06-25 02:21:34
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoying",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoying",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoying","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

“We still have a long way to go. We don't want to go backwards,” Leavitt said.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

The recent education bill (SB 140) passed the legislature by a vote of 56-3 and included critical funding for the many Alaska school districts which are running multi-million dollar deficits. This is primarily due to years of flat funding as inflation drove up costs.

It was a good compromise bill and Dunleavy blew it all up because he had a couple poorly vetted ideas that didn't get in the mix. Nothing more dangerous than a big weird boss with an ego I guess.

Part of the problem... It's us Alaskans. We voted for this guy. I mean, not me and hopefully not you, but some of did.

It was a shock to see him win another four years after a massive statewide recall effort. We hit a wall with covid and couldn't gather enough signatures in time but I thought voters would at least remember the chaos he introduced in 2019. I guess not.

We have a small world up here and I think it's necessary to forget and forgive sometimes so we can get along with our neighbors who annoy us. We learn to live with each other. It's a good skill. Until it's not.

So what do we do now? I don't think another recall is the answer here. It was hard work. It takes too long and costs too much. I suppose if you want to kick in a couple million to fund it, I might change my mind. But the people who carried that effort put in their hours already and it seems a steep ask to rekindle it.

BUT we have legislative elections on the horizon and that's where we can most immediately make our voices heard. There are stooges and lackeys for this governor in the legislature and we need to let them know we see them. We need to pay attention on Monday to whoever refuses to override this veto. And those legislators need to go.

At least that's what I think needs to happen.",2024-03-15 06:46:06
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoyed",Question for hunters/firearm people,"I am headed up to Alaska in June for me and my fiancee to get married. We're planning on doing it out in the wilderness probably up near Hatcher's pass. I'm trying to, amidst the details of planning all of the logistics, balance what I'm hearing as conflicting 'advice' or 'true stories' about being out in the wilderness around there with a group of people for several hours. 

I have a non zero number of people telling me that I should probably have a firearm with me in case wildlife decides to party crash. I also have a non zero number of people telling me that its more likely for me to get mugged at the gas station here in Houston than for anything with teeth to come towards a group of people out there. 

I'm trying to get more of a sense of reality from people there, and with first hand experience. I'm leaning towards not really needing one, and I don't particularly want to have to schlep something up with me and then mail it back (going on a cruise right after), just for a 0.0000001% chance. Not only are the logistics annoying, but my (soon to be) wife isn't a super fan of the idea (or even that I ccw daily anyway), and everyone attending is pretty much anti-gun other than me.

IF I should, and ultimately did however, would a .460 Rowland chambered G21 be sufficient to dissuade anything from treating us like a buffet?

TL;DR= Getting married in June @ Hatcher's pass. Should I have a bear/other gun with me if we're going to be out in the mountains for several hours?

EDIT: Super active discussion, with a lot of good advice, and yet someone is still downloading the s*** out of it? Love ya reddit, never change.

EDIT 2: Maybe I needed to say this clearly, but I guess I didn't - I am not buying a gun, just go up to a 5 hour wedding in Alaska. This would not be my first gun, and in fact it's one I already have, have shot with, and have trained with and run competitions with. This was a question about risk vs logistical pain in the ass - not someone looking for 'an excuse to buy a gun and go shoot things in Alaska'.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoyed","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoyed",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,annoyed","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,worried","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Specifically, we'd be looking at Anchorage, Kodiak, Juneau, Valdez, or maybe Bethel (less likely though.) I'd be working in the power industry, so not too worried about job prospects 

For context, we're considering Alaska for these primary reasons: we love the outdoors, want to have a small homestead, and we want to be around a like minded community that enjoys the same lifestyle. Plus I'd love to work for a company that helps with rural electrification/renewable energy like AVEC or any of the other power coops.

These are my thoughts/questions:

We'd like to visit Anchorage during the ""worst"" time in Alaska for at least a week to see if we can handle the low temp/long nights. Is that like Dec-Jan? Are there any reasons that's a bad idea?

Ive heard cost of living is high and seen stuff like $10 gallons of milk or $45 two-packs of olive oil. Are the groceries just high across the board or could some of the cost be mitigated with lifestyle changes?

We'd like about 2 acres to have goats, chickens, etc. to help with food costs and be more self sufficient. Anybody have experience with that and if it actually helps? Are there other options for cheaper but healthy food?

Housing/acreage seemed surprisingly sparse. Call me silly, but I would have thought there would be more options available. Is the current market pretty standard or is it just a bad time to look. (Perhaps more listings in the summer?)

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,worried",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

[Article here](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2023/10/16/mat-su-district-investigated-teachers-over-student-led-school-board-protests/)

Here's the text: 

PALMER — Students and staff at two Mat-Su high schools say they were questioned by administrators as part of a district-level investigation into a student-led protest at a contentious early September school board meeting.

The protest was centered on a [school board vote last month](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2023/09/07/mat-su-school-board-sharply-limits-role-of-its-student-representative/) to restrict the ability of a sole student representative to participate in public meetings.

The investigation sought to reveal whether teachers had violated a Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District policy banning them from participating in activism at school or politically influencing students, district officials confirmed this week.

It involved more than two dozen students who described being individually questioned by school administrators, as well as at least three teachers, according to interviews with students and staff.

No inappropriate actions by staff were uncovered during the investigation, according to a statement provided by district spokesperson Jillian Morrissey.

The district statement said that members of the school board requested the inquiry, but Morrissey provided no additional information.

Students interviewed for this story said the investigation began a few days after a Sept. 6 school board meeting where the board voted 5-2 to dramatically limit the role of the board’s student representative.

About 10 students spoke in protest of the policy change, while dozens of others attended in protest. Dressed in yellow, students waved small, colorful “Stand for Students” signs taped to paint stirring sticks and lined up to testify against the proposal.

An estimated 30 students at both Wasilla High School and Mat-Su Career & Technical High School were pulled from class or called between periods by school administration staff on the days of Sept. 8 and 11, students and teachers said. They were asked whether any teacher directed or encouraged them to protest and whether instructional time or school supplies were used to create protest materials, such as signage.

At least three teachers who serve as student government advisers — two at Career & Tech and one at Wasilla — were also directly questioned about their influence and any school-funded support, students and staff said.

But protesting at the meeting was entirely the students’ idea, people interviewed for this story told the Daily News.

By questioning whether students were directed to protest by school staff, the board is suggesting students don’t think for themselves, said Quin Schachle, a Wasilla High School senior who is president of both his school’s student government and the districtwide Student Advisory Board’s executive team.

“It felt like that was them taking credit for what I had written and those that I sat down and spent an hour writing that speech,” Schachle said. “It felt really dehumanizing to not be able to have credit for everything that I’ve worked on here.”

A number of school board members did not respond to requests for comment including Ted Swanson and vice president Jubilee Underwood, who voted against the student representative changes; member Kathy McCollum, who voted for the change but said she wants to see more student voice participation; and school board president Tom Bergey.

The Mat-Su school board’s decision to limit the authority of its student representative is the subject of a resolution unanimously approved last weekend by students at the Alaska Association of Student Government fall conference in Fairbanks. The resolution affirms full student representation on school boards statewide.

The school district’s investigation last month involved a [school board policy](https://go.boarddocs.com/ak/matsu/Board.nsf/goto?open&id=C67RJ46E2B80) involving political activities of employees first approved in 1995 and revised in June, officials said.

The investigation began after school board members “heard from constituents about the possible misuse of school resources and reported advocacy about controversial issues occurring by staff” to district administration, according to the statement emailed by Morrissey.

**“**Concerns like this are routinely investigated,” the district statement said. “Although we do not discuss the details of staff or student investigations, we can broadly report that the investigation showed that there was no significant misuse of school resources and that staff actions were appropriate.”

Teachers who said they were questioned included Barbara Jackson, a social studies teacher and student government adviser at Career & Tech; Kristin Shea, a Career & Tech social studies teacher who serves as teacher adviser to the district-wide Mat-Su’s Student Advisory Board executive members; and Karli Rauchenstein, who teaches social studies and advises the student government at Wasilla High School.

News of the questioning created a culture of fear among students at Career & Tech even though they had done nothing wrong, Jackson said this week. When a group of students learned they would be questioned individually, they appeared panicked, she said.

“I did see these looks like ‘Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,’” Jackson said. “And I was like, ‘Guys, you know you are fine, right? You don’t even worry about this for yourself.’”

The investigation was conducted by an assistant principal at Wasilla High School and Career & Tech principal Jason Ross, students and teachers said. Wasilla principal Jason Marvel was not in the building when the investigation was ordered by district staff, students and teachers said.

Both Ross and Marvel declined to comment, citing a district requirement that they refer media questions to the school district public affairs office.

The school board’s current student representative is Ben Kolendo, a senior at Career & Tech High School.

Kolendo this week said the idea for the Sept. 6 student-led protest at the Mat-Su school board meeting initially came from the Career & Tech student government members, who are his friends and support him in his role on the school board.

Until September, the student representative — designated a “board member” by district policy — regularly sat on the dais with other members during meetings and was permitted to fully participate in all but executive sessions, to include questioning witnesses.

But after a May meeting when Kolendo challenged the school board’s selection process for [members of a library book review panel](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2023/05/25/mat-su-school-board-will-choose-some-members-of-challenged-book-committee-instead-of-using-a-lottery/), his seat was moved from the dais to the audience without explanation during the next board meeting in August. The measure to permanently alter the student representative’s involvement was approved the next month.

Most Alaska school boards, including Anchorage’s, allow a student adviser to sit on the dais and ask questions during meetings.

In Mat-Su, the student representative is elected by peers who sit on the district’s student advisory board, which is made up of high school and middle school students who are elected to or apply for the positions. All of the current executive members of that board attend either Wasilla or Career & Tech high schools.

Kolendo said that while Barbara Jackson, his school’s student government adviser, did not tell them to protest or direct students on what to say, she did offer general advice on advocacy best practices, which is part of her role as adviser. That included instruction that students must purchase protest supplies out of pocket, rather than use school supplies, he said.

“All she did during her work day was purely advisory, which is her job as a student government adviser,” Kolendo said.

Ultimately the students did create the signs at the school on a color printer regularly used by students for other noninstructional and politically charged flyers, such as student body Bible clubs or anti-abortion groups, he said.

Jackson said when the students told her they wanted to protest, she was careful to avoid presenting any opinion.

“They clearly had a position — and I did advise them. I did not shy away from that — that’s my job,” she said. “I would describe what I told them as basically Advocacy 101. It would be the same thing I would tell to any group who cared about anything.”

At Wasilla High School, student Schachle said, his peers were primarily worried about possible repercussions for their adviser, Karli Rauchenstein.

Rauchenstein said while she knew no rules had been broken, the questioning felt like a punishment for student political speech that goes against school board opinion.

“I know that I’m doing nothing wrong. I’m willing for anyone to talk to my students, and I’m willing to talk to anyone,” she said. “But the fact that it was done in such a manner feels like it doesn’t matter what my students or I say, that this is a permanent mark on me. And that seems wrong.”",2023-10-17 19:39:14

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,worried",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,worried","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,relieved","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,relieved",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,relieved","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,Thrilled","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,Thrilled",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,scared",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,scared","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,scared",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

PRESS RELEASE
 
Fairbanks' Fountainhead Auto Museum Announces Aviation Partnership and Relocation
 
FAIRBANKS, ALASKA (November 9, 2024) - The Fountainhead Antique Auto Museum, in partnership with the Interior and Arctic Alaska Aeronautical Foundation, operator of the Pioneer Air Museum, is set to establish a new transportation museum on Airport Way, with a move scheduled for fall 2025.
 
The Fountainhead Antique Auto Museum opened in 2009 at Wedgewood Resort and is renowned for having the most extensive collection of antique cars and vintage fashions in the Pacific Northwest. Owner Tim Cerny says it has consistently been named one of the top visitor attractions in Fairbanks and among the top automobile museums in North America. 
 
""We are excited to create a new space in Fairbanks where we can build on that reputation,"" says Cerny. ""Our partnership with the Pioneer Air Museum will allow us to weave together the vibrant histories of aviation and the automobile in the Far North, presented in vivid detail with rare artifacts and captivating exhibits highlighting Alaska's transportation pioneers.""  
 
 
A New Chapter for Alaskan Transportation History
 
Since 1992, the Pioneer Air Museum has displayed an extensive collection of artifacts showcasing interior and arctic Alaska's aviation heritage in the aging ""Gold Dome"" at Pioneer Park. The need for a larger, updated facility has long challenged the museum's preservation and education mission.  
 
Eric Johansen, President of the Board of the Pioneer Air Museum, expressed his enthusiasm for the new partnership: “I am extremely excited about the future of this museum. It focuses on a unique chapter in Alaskan aviation history and aims to tell that story in a world-class way. The museum will be a must-visit for residents and visitors alike, who will come away with a real appreciation of the many obstacles overcome by Alaska's early aviation pioneers.”
 
According to Cerny, the new Fountainhead Transportation Museum will provide exhibit and storage space for over 135 vintage automobiles, several rare airplanes, thousands of historic fashions, and other rare artifacts. Aviation treasures from the Pioneer Air Museum, such as the Norseman Airplane and the remains of Ben Eielson's plane, will be carefully moved to the new facility. TOTE Maritime Alaska and the Alaska Railroad recently donated shipping for two additional historic Alaska airplanes from Spokane, Washington, to Fairbanks. We thank our transportation partners who helped make this happen.  
 
 
Enhanced Facilities for Cars, Planes, and Historic Artifacts
 
The new Fountainhead Transportation Museum will be located at 3121 Airport Way, fondly remembered as the old Kmart building, which is now partially occupied by an Amazon fulfillment center. Cerny's company, Fountainhead Development, Inc., has been working with Design Alaska to create 90,000 square feet of exhibit space, a restoration area, climate-controlled artifact storage, a gift shop, a reception area for groups, and a catering kitchen.  
 
""Nowhere in the continental United States did the airplane play such a significant historical role as it did in Alaska. I think it is so exciting that Tim Cerny has agreed to include Alaskan Aviation history along with his world-class auto museum. With the new location, I'm sure it will all become a must-see for visitors and historians."" Fairbanksan and Alaskan aviation legend Richard Wein adds. 
 
The Fountainhead Transportation Museum operates under the 501(c)(3) Fountainhead Museum Foundation, which includes an endowment managed through the Alaska Community Foundation. Bill Green from the Pioneer Air Museum board of directors was appointed to the Museum Foundation's board. 
 
The building at Wedgewood Resort, currently housing the auto and fashion museum, will be transformed into a 30,000-square-foot conference and event center capable of handling events with up to 800 attendees. 
 
This relocation marks an exciting new chapter for one of Alaska's top-rated museums. Stay tuned for updates as the Fountainhead Transportation Museum prepares to open its doors in 2025.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,excited","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,excited",5 Days in Kenai Peninsula ,"Hello all, my girlfriend and I are super excited to be visiting Alaska for the first time in July. We already have our rental car booked. I was looking to get some recommendations for our 5 full days there. We love nature, culture, hiking, music, and food. Taking everyone's advice for our time restrictions, we will only be doing the Kenai Peninsula this time around.

Days 1-3: On our first full day we will be driving down to Seward in the morning from Anchorage. We currently have the first two nights booked in Seward where we are wanting to do a glacier cruise and some kayaking. Any recommendations on companies would be much appreciated. 

Days 3-5: We then spend the next two nights in Homer. Any recommendations on things to do there would be great. However, I'm wondering if 2 nights in Homer is too much... We definitely want to explore the town but I'm thinking maybe doing one night would be enough? I wonder if spending the other night in Soldotna or Coopers Landing would be better, maybe book a rafting trip down the river or spend a half a day fishing for trout or salmon.  What do you all think?

Days 5-6: The last night we'll stay in Anchorage and spend the morning exploring Anchorage before catching our afternoon flight home. 

Let me know what you guys think, definitely open to changes.",2024-05-21 13:51:48
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,excited",Need help for a documentary ,"Hello! I am doing some research for an upcoming documentary on the visible effects of climate change in alaska. What I ask of this subreddit is help finding locations for the visual content of the documentary. More specifically, I am looking for locations along the dalton highway and northern slopes that exemplify permafrost degradation. I am looking for drunken forests, high wildlife areas, and anything visually interesting, particularly if it has relevance to the changing landscape.

The documentary will be following a multi week schedule in which my team will be driving from fairbanks to deadhorse via the dalton highway. If there are any locations along this route that folks know of, I would greatly appreciate the help so that I may begin to create a more detailed and specific itinerary. Thanks!",2024-06-25 02:21:34
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,excited",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

'Alaska USA Federal Credit Union
Dear Member,

We are proud to announce that on April 3, 2023, Alaska USA Federal Credit Union will be changing its name to Global Federal Credit Union. This name change, the fourth name change in our company’s history, marks a significant milestone in our credit union’s journey, providing an opportunity to reflect on everything that Alaska USA has stood for and everything that we aspire to become as we move forward into an exciting future.

This new brand name is a better description of a membership that is distributed worldwide and more illustrative of our organizational commitment to accessibility anytime, anywhere in the world. We recognize that many of our members, like me, were born and raised in Alaska and have had accounts at Alaska USA for a long time. I want to assure you that the credit union is still Alaskan to our core; Alaska is in our DNA. When you walk into a branch you’ll be greeted by the same employees, use the same accounts, and experience the same commitment to the financial wellbeing of our communities that you’ve come to expect from us. Global is simply a new name with the same Alaskan spirit and values that have always guided us.

Our subsidiary companies are also adopting the Global name. Alaska USA Insurance Brokers will be known as Global Credit Union Insurance Brokers, and Alaska USA Mortgage Company will be known as Global Credit Union Home Loans.

Since we were founded in 1948 as Alaskan Air Depot Federal Credit Union, our organization has expanded far beyond the confines of the Air Depot and the borders of Alaska. As your families grew, we grew. We now have members in all 50 states and all over the world. We have branches in Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Washington, and even on military bases in Italy. We’ve grown to become what Alaska always has been—larger than life. Global.

I am excited to be on this journey with you and look forward to serving your financial needs for many years to come. We truly believe there is Strength in Members.

With great appreciation,

Global Credit Union'
Just got an email that As of April 3, AK USA will now be 'Global Federal Credit Union'. The last few months their phone customer service has seemingly become largely pushed to out of state people that are as unhelpful as other banks. I have loved this Credit Union for 10+ years, and now am sad to have to move my accounts elsewhere because even the news of the change has made it obvious how the last few months of horrible CS and other policy changes are due to this new change. Just a heads up to all that use them, that things are changing, have been changing, and it isn't for us Alaskans.

Not all calls have gone to out of state, that was a false absolute statement, I should have instead said that a majority of my recent calls have gone to out of state folks that have had a completely different attitude than the locals.  Can I be mad at a business for making moves to make more money? Nah. Can I feel a large sense of frustration and almost betrayal from new rules etc and CS interactions that have led me to believe that this rebranding is to make more money, get more customers etc all while no longer having the same consistency of amazing service? Absolutey I can, and it comes from history of what happens to companies when they expand. 

It's the end of an era, and to act differently is being unwilling to use logic and examples to see exactly where this is now heading.",2023-01-19 23:36:37

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,excited",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,excited","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,Ruined","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,Ruined",Need help for a documentary ,"Hello! I am doing some research for an upcoming documentary on the visible effects of climate change in alaska. What I ask of this subreddit is help finding locations for the visual content of the documentary. More specifically, I am looking for locations along the dalton highway and northern slopes that exemplify permafrost degradation. I am looking for drunken forests, high wildlife areas, and anything visually interesting, particularly if it has relevance to the changing landscape.

The documentary will be following a multi week schedule in which my team will be driving from fairbanks to deadhorse via the dalton highway. If there are any locations along this route that folks know of, I would greatly appreciate the help so that I may begin to create a more detailed and specific itinerary. Thanks!",2024-06-25 02:21:34
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,Ruined",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14

Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,Ruined",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Climate change,Ruined","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.

Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love","Ever just sit there and think ""wow, I live in Alaska""?","I was born here, lived here 35 years - my whole life - though I was on foreign exchange to Germany for a year in high school.

I have a core memory that contains a feeling I've had many times since it happened. One day as my parents were driving me to the elementary school I went to. I looked at the mountains, as I had many times before, and thought something along the lines of ""Wow. I live in Alaska. Most people view Alaska as a special place, and I live here. The place I live is so different from most people, and so majestic."" I was thinking of people in the US as a whole at the time, rather than globally, and obviously my thoughts were not as verbose, but that was the vibe of them. They happened every time I was on that ride to school, and they regularly happen to this day when I'm outdoors and look at my surroundings. Not every day, but frequent enough.

Ever just bask in the uniqueness of the place we live, no matter how ordinary it is to you? Did anyone else who grew up here have that realization one day, that you're not growing up or living in some generic place, you're in *Alaska*? A place that to my elementary school mind not only was the *only* place I knew, but was also fabled in the readings and teachings I absorbed as a child. It's like one day I connected those dots and haven't been able to shake it since.

When I lived abroad on exchange, that feeling was just amplified. I was absolutely stunned and mindblown by the sights in Germany. Just gazing at ancient buildings in absolute wonder, staring at actual skyscrapers in Frankfurt and feeling smaller than I've ever felt (even more than when viewing a mountain many times bigger, just because the skyscraper is manmade and surrounded by other skyscrapers and tall buildings). So much more, too. 

However, my interactions with the people I encountered solidly reinforced my feeling that my true home was a special place. When I told people where I was from, they always reacted in a special way they didn't do for people from other places. Often something starting with the equivalent of ""oh wow, that's so awesome"" acting like they just ran into someone from a strange and wondrous land. Nothing too extreme, but an obvious acknowledgement that you're not from some typical or expected place - and it's a place they know about and have heard tales of.

I fucking love this state and don't want to live anywhere else, no matter how much I like other places. There's just something about simply being here that is so special. Anyone else feel that?

Just posting this because I felt this feeling and felt like writing about it. I'm not bashing other places - they have their own uniqueness and great qualities, but I just love where we live.",2024-09-27 18:00:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Alaska becoming bad for families?,"I love this state. Ive lived here all my life and want my children to grow up here but I don’t know if I can do it anymore. I’ve had to take 6 (SIX!) vacation days because schools were closed. The superintendent insists that it is because the streets are unplowed and I believe him. I’ve never seen our main roads this bad, let alone our neighborhood roads. And none of the closures have been blizzards or emergencies, just normal snowfall!

In the summer, I want to take my kids on the same trails I played on with my friends as a kid. But they are filled with homeless people, some of whom have assaulted and SA’d minors. Even supervised, it doesn’t seem like a safe place for kids.

My wife and I are debating moving somewhere where the government can keep the city and state running and safe. It breaks my heart that nobody seems to care about keeping this state functioning. Especially with all the “best place for families” talk that is clearly just lip service.",2023-12-13 19:31:14

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Seeking legal help on foreclosure of our off grid cabin in Alaska,"My wife and I had a dream to move to Alaska and live off grid and we finally made our dreams come true in May of 2022. 

When we met an author and her husband we fell in love with their story and their lake cabin in rural Alaska. We made an offer of 250,000 cash and 25,000 financing and they accepted it.

This year we had some life events happen and ended up having to move into town…my wife got pregnant after we were told we could not get pregnant naturally and we didn’t find out until we came into town because she was having terrible stomach pain. We were so excited for our little blessing however we were told we needed to stay in town because she had a placenta tear and if it got any worse they would have to admit her and needed her to come in for weekly visits. 

During that time we fell one payment behind on our mortgage and we were making payments late and paying the late fees as we were getting caught up. When we came into town we only had the clothes on our back, our 3 children (from wife’s previous marriage) and our dog. Finding a job, a place to rent, hitting up every food bank we could, starting from scratch for all household needs, doctors appointments and everything we needed for the kids and new baby became the focus as we navigated our new reality. 

A couple days ago we were mailed a foreclosure letter about our cabin. When we reached out to our mortgage company we found out the sellers did an audit on our account and we were just over $300 behind and our normal payments are about $470. After the audit they closed the account and we had no idea because we made a payment July 21st and no one told us our account was closed and the mortgage company ended up sending us a check back for our about $470 payment. When we reached out to the escrow and foreclosure company they said we have to pay around $6,400 by August 30 to take our cabin out of foreclosure. Unfortunately at this time we do not have that kind of money. 

We are blown away because we have made every payment except for the now two payments of just above $300 and regular payment around $470. We are also being charged with lawyer fees now and fees to bring the property out of foreclosure but that still doesn’t seem to add up to $6400. We are seeking help from lawyers and real estate representatives in our area but really do not want to lose our cabin and investment of 255,000 cash we have already paid the sellers. 
Any help legally or any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!!",2023-08-20 16:57:07
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Hikes and climbing,"Hi, we are a young couple in our 20s visiting alaska next august. We will be there for three weeks and will be in Anchorage, the Kenai Peninsula in general, seward, and juneau.

We are also open to some more leisurely hikes for low key days. I am wondering if anyone has any feedback or advice about the following hikes we are considering, or other recommendations. Also if anyone knows of any multipitch climbs they recommend around 5.7-5.9 we would love to hear it.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Electric vs. GPS fences for dogs in Alaska,"I've got a small farm and a large livestock guardian dog who loves to run off the fox, coyotes, porcupines, moose, bears, all of it.  However, I live a few hundred yards from the highway, am on a river, and have the train tracks bordering one side of the property.  I NEED to keep the dog off the tracks.  We have a few acres so a buried fence wouldn't be the best option.  I'm also unsure of how they would work with deep snow.

Does anyone know if GPS collars work without direct supervision?   I have tried a Petsafe perimeter unit that works with a slightly customizable circumference but it did not help as our land is narrow not wide and allowed the tracks into the safezone.   I was also worried about the dog crossing the line, getting shocked, and not being able to come back without being shocked.  When he chases or tracks something, he goes wholeheartedly at fullspeed.  I currently have a Tractive collar that notifies my phone within two minutes when he goes out of my customized area, but I can't rely on it when I am not home and have been tying him up to be safe when I leave.  

Dogs get hit by the train all the time - they don't seem to realize that it's gonna kill them.  Does anyone have any recommendations to help me keep my animals alive?  Fences are out - the electric ones tangle up the moose and regular fences go under the snow.  He keeps the livestock protected and I'd like to protect him by keeping him from dangers that he doesn't realize are there.  I have the time and love to have training time with him, I just can't seem to get him to respect the boundaries of the property.  We walk the borders every day at least once, if not twice.  Thanks for your time everybody!

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love","Thinking of moving, need ideas","30f. The long, cold, dark winters seem to be getting worse and I need new scenery (physically and mentally) to grow as a person and gain more experience. 

I love the small town feel of the valley while still having access to decent amenities. 

I can’t do big cities and spend an hour in traffic every day. 

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons. 

But not regular temperatures over 90. 

I appreciate all ideas!",2024-08-19 00:36:39

>Alaskans, I have so much to thank you for.  
>  
>The past month has been one of the most difficult in my life. [Losing my husband](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/rural-alaska/2023/09/13/rep-mary-peltolas-husband-killed-in-plane-crash-in-alaska/), Buzzy, has changed me forever. Having lost my mother earlier this year, it was hard to imagine what my life would look like now without them.  
>  
>But in the darkest moments, you showed me such kindness and grace.  
>  
>Immediately after the news broke, you were calling my office to share your condolences and prayers. Our senators and governor reached out personally, offering support for my staff and family.  
>  
>In Bethel, you [packed Buzzy’s funeral](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2023/09/19/hundreds-of-mourners-gather-in-bethel-for-funeral-of-eugene-buzzy-peltola-jr/) with more people than I could have imagined. In Anchorage, his 40-day celebration was just as well-attended. Buzzy was someone who made an impression on everyone he met — and it seems like he had truly met everyone! The amount of wonderful stories I’ve heard from Alaskans about their experiences with him have helped me to see the love that he inspired in the world, and that has been truly healing for me.  
>  
>I am so thankful for the space that you have given me to celebrate Buzzy’s life with my family, and for all you who celebrated it with us. The warmth and generosity that you have shown represents Alaska at its best.  
>  
>While my life will never be the same, I am still deeply honored to serve as Alaska’s Representative, and I want you to know that your voices are being heard in Washington, D.C. I have been back in the Capitol, working to represent you and pass a budget that protects Alaska from an unnecessary government shutdown, creates jobs, and invests in our infrastructure and families. With a new Speaker, we have a chance for a new start.  
>  
>As I was in the process of returning to Washington, D.C., I was thinking a lot about why Alaska is different, and this is what I think. So many of the people who reached out to offer their support and comfort mentioned how they had gone through something similar — how they had known someone else who passed away doing something they loved in the great outdoors of our incredible state.  
>  
>**It made me realize at a deeper level something that I’ve always believed, which is that Alaskans care so deeply and naturally for each other because we face and understand so many of the same challenges. We know that we are a small population in a big state, and the neighbor we politically disagree with might also be the neighbor who we need to help pull us out of a snowbank or a river. That Alaska camaraderie is what has helped us establish a new model of politics, an “Alaska model” that prioritizes bipartisanship and unifying coalitions over division and blame-casting.**  
>  
>When I returned to Washington, D.C., I was expecting a return to the partisan atmosphere that has been all too common in our Capitol. But I was surprised by a wonderfully human moment — applause from both sides of the chamber as I cast my first vote for Speaker after taking time to grieve with my children.  
>  
>It was only one moment, but that simple human gesture of kindness meant the world to me, and it showed me that a better version of Congress — a more Alaskan version — is possible. If we can return to seeing each other as people, not as partisans, then our government can start to heal from dysfunction.  
>  
>Thank you once more to all those who offered their comfort and prayers. You have made a dark time just that much lighter and showed me again why I ran for this office in the first place.  
>  
>Buzzy spent his life serving and advocating for Alaskans, building relationships and bringing people together. While he may be gone, that spirit endures in so many Alaskans, and it will always be my north star.

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Bringing mainland stuff to Alaska?,"So something I've done ever since I was young anytime I traveled far away I would try to buy an even sell or trade with where I was going. Coming to Alaska and I might want to get myself a totem and maybe some other goodies, but I was wondering if there were things that people up there would love to pickup? I know the internet has changed this for the most part, but thinking when I went to Hawaii (post internet),I brought Dr Pepper, Twinkies, ding dongs and I even brought some blue jeans to a friend of mine. He mentioned that if I packed a suitcase full of that stuff, that other people would be interested. I did it and the stuff didn't last 20 minutes some of the neighbors and passerbys cleaned me out.
 
At first it seemed a little weird, but I've done this in different states and countries. Not that I'm going to sit there and pack an entire suitcase full of Twinkies and ding dongs, but I thought it'd be nice to bring a couple of items. (Even as tip or a little thank you). I grew up in a relatively isolated area so I know what it's like trying to get stuff imported. This time's a little weird because I don't know anybody that lives there, but, in the past I've always had good luck with making a deal and/or making someone's day. Any thoughts or advice is greatly appreciated :-)",2024-05-01 21:58:41
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

The next places will be costing on the cruise are: Hubbar Glacier, Glacier Bay National Park, Skagway, Juneau and lastly Ketchikan. So I’m just wondering what would be some once in a lifetime must have buy souvenirs, gifts, and etc to get myself?

Thought.  Quit current job, find some job in Alaska, Fly, and get ratings.  

Would find work prior to arrival, and have some money.  

Thanks in advance!!

Quesions?

Odds of picking up work in aviation in Alaska going this route.  Word of mouth, local, ect.

I currently fly Wa. State.  My thought is, IFeel there is no better place to get ratings. continue learning to get good than Alaska.

I am single, no kids.  Bit of a loner naturaly.  But, would love to meet someone someday.  Will this be harder in AK?

I was looking to get some recommendations for our 5 full days there. We love nature, culture, hiking, music, and food. Taking everyone's advice for our time restrictions, we will only be doing the Kenai Peninsula this time around.

Days 1-3: On our first full day we will be driving down to Seward in the morning from Anchorage. We currently have the first two nights booked in Seward where we are wanting to do a glacier cruise and some kayaking. Any recommendations on companies would be much appreciated. 

Days 3-5: We then spend the next two nights in Homer. Any recommendations on things to do there would be great. However, I'm wondering if 2 nights in Homer is too much... We definitely want to explore the town but I'm thinking maybe doing one night would be enough? I wonder if spending the other night in Soldotna or Coopers Landing would be better, maybe book a rafting trip down the river or spend a half a day fishing for trout or salmon.  What do you all think?

Days 5-6: The last night we'll stay in Anchorage and spend the morning exploring Anchorage before catching our afternoon flight home.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Kenai Vacation Advice!,"Hi all, looking to take a big Alaska vacation in May!  My fiancé and I are heading up from May 11-18 to celebrate our birthdays.  We were planning on flying into Anchorage, renting a car for the week, driving north to Trapper Creek area for three nights to explore the Denali region and do some hiking.  After that we plan to head to Kenai peninsula for four nights and this is where we are seeking advice.  We were advised by a friend that Seward and Homer are must sees.  Problem being, they are 3 hours drive apart which would be a little too far to stay in one and take a day trip to the other.  

Would you recommend one of Seward or Homer over the other?  Should we look to stay in the middle somewhere (Soldotna, Kenai, Sterling) and take day drives to both spots?  Am I thinking too much like a lower 48er- is it possible to catch a flight between the two towns for a day trip?

We love hiking and fishing, looking to see some wild life (fiancé has yet to see a wild moose, its on her bucket list), maybe a sight seeing flight, would love to catch a charter boat out of Homer for some halibut.

I have a few ideas so far but would like some advice from anyone who has been before or is from the area.
We are most likely flying into Anchorage and planning to do things that we can reach from there by car.
So far these are my ideas:
Kenai Fjords National Park for 2/3 days

Denali or Wrangell St. Elias
Trying to decide between the two, leaning towards Wrangell because of less crowds, but I’d love to hear cases for both to help me make a decision. Would like to see as much wildlife as possible and am open to hiking trails, however not looking to do anything that would take the entire day (more than 6hrs) or require us to camp overnight. Open to staying in whichever area for a few nights to see as much as possible comfortably.

McCarthy to Valdez
Heard the drive is beautiful. Don’t know what there is to see in Valdez but wondering if it’s worth it to go.

Homer
We really want to go fishing and there seems to be a lot of halibut charter boat tours that seem fun

Everyone seems to agree that spending as little time in Anchorage as possible is the way to go. I know for sure I’d like to see the museum and wildlife center, but other than that, I’m not sure. We are thinking of staying the first night or two there so if anyone has any suggestions, that would be helpful. So far we have not booked any activities or accommodation so I’m open to any input!

This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",need help finding the best jerky I've ever had,"Context: in the summer my partner and I had wonderful trip to Anchorage, long drive down to Homer, and back again. We were in the state for a total of 9 days. I literally, don't like beef jerky - every kind I've ever had from a store has been dry and too salty or not a good flavor (also a teriyaki hater). HOWEVER, wherever we were in Alaska we were able to find some bomb ass jerky that I actually enjoyed, was subtly sweet, and not too too sticky on our fingers. 


But I have a dodongo brain, and cannot for the life of me remember what the brand the jerky was. I remember a few key attributes

- honey was a listed ingredient (but, it Honey wasn't the ""flavor"" name, or anything)
- came in a clear bag with a label slapped on
- it had a black-pepper flavor variety, that I think had the honey ingredient, but I'm not sure
- I'm 99% certain it's not Old Trapper, Tillamook, Jack Links, or anything else you can find on the mainland. This was an Alaskan brand


And that's it. I would love some help finding this because I've searched online for months, and I cannot seem to find this bag/brand of jerky. Much love and thanks to y'all 🙏🙏🙏

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Halibut fishing charters and other info-thanks!,"

My apologies, I'm sure this has been covered, Reddit search function is terrible though, I've tried looking. I'm coming to Seward late August. Halibut is a bucket list fish of mine, but would love to catch a salmon or possibly others. Halibut is definitely my goal though.

Does anyone have recommendations for a charter boat? Will be me and my wife, so unfortunately I can't swing a private charter. I would love a recommendation of a charter that is going to be serious about fishing and finding good fish. I don't need nice people or nice boats haha, although those things never hurt. Definitely was hoping to use this subreddit to find a charter that locals would use because they know what they are doing, and it's not just a party boat etc.

Alternatively, we wanted to explore part of Kenai Fjords by boat, and saw that Alaskan Coastal Explorer offers a split day of halibut salmon fishing / fjords sight seeing. Was wondering if anyone had used this service. Something tells me I'd be disappointed in the fishing, and I don't mean that disrespectfully, I feel like this type of trip does have a specific purpose and would be great for many. If it truly offers good fishing and sightseeing, that definitely can't be beat

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Driving vs. Sailing vs. Shipping- Analysis Paralysis,"I'm going down to Seattle from Anchorage in mid-April and trying to figure out how to best move my car and me.

Here are the options I've considered: 

* driving (5-6 days) (hotels, gas, etc.) about $1,700
* driving to Haines (2 days) + sailing to Bellingham about $2,500 ($1,900 if I don't get a stateroom)
* shipping + flying about $1,700 + ubers while I'm carless

Sailing seems like it'll give me a good mix of sightseeing and work/free time but is the most expensive. 

I'm unsure about how nice the sightseeing is sailing vs. driving. Moreover, I don't know when I'll have an opportunity to drive/sail down the northern west coast again so want to hear if it's a worthwhile endeavor or a boring waste of time.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I appreciate any help or suggestions-  thank you!",2024-01-17 04:20:52

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Looking for local advise on places to visit,"Hello All, 

I plan to visit Alaska for the first time with my wife later this year during the summer months. Our high level literary would be to stay in Anchorage for a few days, train trip to Fairbanks, stay for a few more days then depart. A week total, we have been saving for two years and finally can have a vacation :) 

I've checked out the link on the side panel and found some cool places. I've also watched a few youtube videos where folks visit. Out of those I've decided to visit the following while in these places if time allows: 

Anchorage Points of Interest: 

* Alaska Wildlife conservation center
* Alaska heritage center
* Anchorage Museum
* Tony Knowles Coastal Trail
* Day trip to Talkeetna (I read that we should try the Spinach bread?)

Anchorage Food: 

* Snow City Cafe
* Firs Island Bake Shop
* The Kobuk (Im a big fan of Tea) 
* Mooses Tooth
* Glacier Brewhouse

Fairbanks Points of Interest: 

* Museum of the North
* Pioneer Park
* Ice Museum
* Fountainhead Antique Auto Museum
* Day trip to North Pole AK (Wife is a huge fan of Christmas)

Fairbanks Food: 

* Fairbanks Brewery
* Cookie Jar Resturant
* Alaska Salmon Bake

My wife and I love the outdoors and hiking but she is not as able as she used to be so I need to keep our hiking on the easier side. We would both like to see a glacier but I couldnt seem to find one that I didnt have to pay a crazy amount of money to see. Also she loves animals, if possible Id like to take her somewhere she could see or bonus points pet animals like reindeer or sled dogs... she would absolutely love to see sled dogs. Id also like to get a chance to see the North lights if that happens to occur, so if you all know a good place to view them from or just to view the sunset Id appreciate that.",2023-05-12 17:37:13
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,love",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",PSA - xtratufs are not fashionable….,"Ladies of Alaska, I hate to break it to you but xtratufs are rain boots and should be worn appropriately. I realize they have “cute” prints on the liner, but still, they are to be worn in rainy/fishing/wet areas.  Please stop being lazy and put some efforts into your look!!

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Really GCI?,"My Internet goes down for half a day due to the storm at the end of last week, and you decide this is an appropriate time to re-IP my entire network thus breaking my home security system, DVR and backup NAS because those things weren't using DHCP for obvious reasons?



Then I get to download your shitty spyware app on my phone just to find out I can't even change the goddamn settings back?



And I can't even insulate myself from you idiots without doing double NAT and losing UPnP (because no bridge mode options on the device now)?



I think you guys need to reconsider that application I put in for VP of Engineering, because y'all need serious help from competent engineers. Actually, better yet, don't. I would clearly be working on the world's most shortsighted executive team. 



Any network engineers dealt with this and want to chime in to save me the time researching or dealing with support? Will GCI support me buying my own modem so I can get rid of the Sagemcom unified device? Can you recommend a modem?



I honestly didn't understand the hate for GCI until literally today. My service had always been reliable and fast since I got it a couple years ago. I never needed to interact with support. Now I'm fucking *heated* about these assholes. The absolute audacity of randomly re-addressing a customer's network is something I cannot comprehend.",2023-11-13 00:48:56
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Overcoming Nostalgia ,"My family and I moved away from AK over 7 years ago when I was just 11 years old... but as each year passes and the more l've grown up and come of age living in California, the harder and more homesick I get for Alaska. It's become so bad to the point where not a day goes by when I don't start reminiscing and thinking back to growing up in such a beautiful place.
For context, I was born in Fairbanks and my family and I moved a lot across AK, mainly in small villages (only accessible by bush plane) across Central and Northern Alaska. It was so hard for us to live, but now when I look back I only see the positives.

I know it's not the most ideal state for living, and I remember when I was actually growing up there I really hated it. I hated living in Alaska as a kid because it felt so isolating and lonely and obviously very cold, and it was difficult for my parents to provide for my siblings and I and I could see the toll it took on them to work and live in quite literally the middle of nowhere.

I think I've just grown bitter about living in the Bay Area and am sick of the cost of living and sheer volume of people that live here, and l've also grown fearful that living in the Bay has made me lose my identity as an Alaskan and lose a lot of the qualities I like to think Alaskans have like resilience and grit and toughness. Or maybe I just miss being a kid, like most people. My family and l often discuss wanting to go back to Anchorage or Fairbanks just for a visit, but it's never come to fruition because of how
expensive a trip would be. I honestly don't want to go back to living in Alaska, but it's been over 7 years since l've left and I just want to return back to the place where I was born and raised even just for a little bit. Sorry for the venting, I just wasn't sure where else to put this.",2024-10-04 06:11:45
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",NYC to Cooper Landing,"I’ll possibly be moving to the area for work in the next few months. The job itself is in cooper landing, but I really like the Seward area, which brings me to my question. Is a daily commute from Seward to cooper landing too much? 2 hours a day sounds like I might hate my life, but I’m moving from NYC and very concerned about living somewhere so remote like CL

What does moving to Alaska from somewhere like NYC look like? Especially as a single 30 year old. A little nervous about the adjustment in lifestyle. The whole population of CP is how many people live on my block rn 🤣

How accessible is the area? What does life look like in terms of typical day to day shit like groceries, getting deliveries, housing, etc. - as well as meeting people, going to events, things like that. 

Any thoughts/advice greatly appreciated ♥️",2024-04-04 20:55:16
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Alaska travel during September,"Hello, we are planning to visit Alaska (4 day trip) during the last week of September this year. We thought of it at the last minute. Can you please let me know if it is a bad idea to visit considering the rainy weather and closure of many touristy activities? We are hoping to see the Northern lights but we are travelling to Anchorage. Is it better to travel to Fairbanks instead? ",2023-09-12 20:17:27
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Do Kenai Fjord Tours sellout?,We are planning our first trip to Alaska this upcoming summer and are interested in taking one of the Kenai boat tours most likely either Major Marine or Kenai Fjord Tours. They both appear to be recommended and similar in options and price points. We have a 3 day window to take the tour the last week of July during the week (not weekend). I would prefer to book a day when we know we will have good weather. I would hate to book something now and then regret we chose a bad weather day. As long as there is plenty of availability we will book a few days ahead unless there is any recommendation the tours sell out in advance. If they do tend to sell out how many days/weeks/months does that typically start. Thanks in advance and bonus points if there is any recommendation in towards one tour company over another!,2024-01-11 03:56:21
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Tips (if willing) for Sitka visit,"Hi folks, 

I've lurked and read for a bit so I'm trying to take the chance to use a surprisingly cheap ticket to sitka to simply appreciate, learn, and wander some. 

My trip is currently 4ish days because of work things. 

I'm able bodied, female, late 20s. Climb, hike, traveled internationally. I always aim to not be an idiot, but there's always a secret way to be an idiot that you discover while being stupid. If the biggest tip you have is ""bring a friend,"" I hear you and can shake the social tree.

I love history, don't sleep a ton (night is not my limiter, barring safety) and am not shy.  

I'd love any tips for worthwhile quirks, views, people who don't hate a tourist, and any tips on housing? I grock that Alaska is expensive but for some reason was still knocked on my butt by $250/night for a hotel.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,hate",A Poem Welcoming Pete Buttigieg to the Chilkat Valley,"Good morning r/Alaska. I wrote this poem welcoming Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to the Chilkat Valley today for the literary entertainment paper I publish locally—hope you enjoy!

###The Ballad of Chilkoot Pete

Pete, Oh, Pete!  
Transport this rural poem away  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
From a mining town armed to the teeth  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
With $20 million to lure mining concerns  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
A project for the establishment to posture over  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
While they rob and hunt the poor  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
And irrigate their own lawns  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
With our spilled lifeblood   
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
Do you know where you're visiting?  

Minorities terrorized by hate speech  
Officials paying friends for fake work  

($100,000 of public money to write  
A college paper that sez: “Mining Gud!"")  

Property values criminally re-appraised  
Countless brown bears murdered  

Greenies getting tires slashed  
Monopoly healthcare poisoning the poor  

Police department hunting the autistic  
While drunks split up their possessions  
(And employees get paid in stolen parrots)

An “animal shelter” that robs from the weak  
And gives to themselves and their friends  

An establishment that culls the disabled   
And the unwanted or unliked and unpopular  
(Using public institutions and resources)  

Local non-profits that goad the victims of drunks  
Through a Medicaid wood-chipper purpose built  

For the grisly grist-work of a mining town  
Caught deep in the throes of self-cannibalizaton   

Transport Pete!  
Your $20 million a Trojan’s gift  
As corporatists do $200 million  
In long-term damage  
Fighting over the poisoned pie  
Doled out from and sliced in DC  
Making our officials too lazy  
And indolent   
(And stupid)  
(And far too violent)  
To ever fund a dock themselves   
“Hey—now we can fight over *this*!”  
—both sides of the mine movement  
::sounds of oppression intensify offstage::  

Gone are the days of economics  
And industry  
And conservation  
And work   
(And safety)  
(And health)  
In Haines Alaska  
The talent's been run out  
Intelligence ridiculed to isolation   
Artists put against the wall  
And ethics burned at the stake  

Just drunks and assassins now  
Fighting over cheap baubles   
Thrown by corporatist masters   
Who walk with box wine wobbles   

Transport Pete!  
You bribe the violent and corrupt with candy   
Transport Pete!  
And come for the free press  
Transport Pete!  
But you won't see The Chilkat Pirate  
Transport Pete!  
Nor any of my staff  
Transport Pete!  
Scouring for musketeers and snickers  
Transport Pete!  
Beneath the broken Haines pinata  
Transport Pete!  
From *Mud Bay* we render your free press  
Transport Pete!  
As outlaws safely *outside* of jurisdiction   
Transport Pete!  
And through this valley no eagle shall pass  
Transport Pete!  
Without suffering folkloric interdiction  

So 'ere you go, have a carrot:  
With this tapping on your door  
Not a Raven comes, but a Parrot  
To settle the Eagle’s score  

For with no well earned salmon grasped  
Did Transport Pete darken *our* door  

No, with a corpse-scavenger's  
Black-blooded offal talons  
And rotten breath beak  
Came Transport Pete to play  
A little hide and seek  

Where Robin Hood comes a nocking  
And the Chilkat Valley knows to duck  
For there's no way to stop the mocking  
Of hermits who give no fuck  

History's clocking *you*  
This Pirate knows it well  
Everything I say is true—  
Please enjoy your stay in Hell!",2023-08-16 18:36:53

With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Moving to Alaska is not the solution to your problems,"Let's talk about the truth about moving to Alaska. Feel free to disagree, but I'll start here: 
 
1) **Basic cable TV shows about/set in Alaska are not real.** They're 100% fiction. They  exist because the State of Alaska gave huge tax incentives to production companies to make shows here to lure tourists. Think of them as 1970s toy commercials.  

2)  The whole state is suffering from a dangerous shortage of critical services.  You are endangering the life of anyone who has mental health issues by moving them to Alaska, including yourself and your children. *See also* McCandless, Chris, who is not a folk hero here. 

3) When (not if)  anyone you leave behind Outside has a medical emergency, you won't make it there on time.  My mother missed her own mothers' death and both her siblings' funerals because they all died in the winter, when it's 24-36 hours minimum to get to the East Coast, despite having the ability to pay for a same day ticket. (Contrary to popular belief Alaska Airlines does not have to sell you a cheap bereavement fare on a full plane and will not do so. You can expect to spend $1400 RT to get as far as Seattle at times.)  

**You're not going to be the exception to any of this.** 

4) Need housing? There isn't much available. It's all really, really overpriced.  It's very low quality. It may have earthquake damage that isn't obvious. You're not going to be the one who finds the unicorn affordable perfect lakeside cabin with no shitty neighbors on a good road with great internet service. You are much more likely to find yourself trying to pull black mold out of the basement sheetrock in the middle of a November power outage, only to find that your basement was never properly dried in and the studs are rotting out.  

5) Your uncle/grandfather/neighbor down the street made a bundle of cash working on a slime line **40+ years ago.**  Employers haven't had to do that in a long time so they don't.  Salaries haven't kept up with the cost of living like they have other places.  That's why all the housing looks like hell.  

**You aren't going to be the one person who finds a great job that pays more than it would anywhere else, because people who are from here and have the right connections aren't getting those.**

6)  Alaska has never been a ""conservative"" state in the same mold that Alabama claims to be a ""conservative"" (e.g. white percale enthusiast) state.  Right wing social/religious politics are about as popular as a turd in a punchbowl with almost everyone who isn't (a) over 65 or (b) a portly middle aged white guy with a goatee in a Ram pickup. 

This ain't Texas. There are some people who try to pretend otherwise, but: 

**People came to Alaska to get away from that bullshit.**


7) Nobody on this sub is ""gatekeeping"" Alaska.  Nobody wants to see people fail. People want new friends and neighbors they like. Alaskans enjoy introducing their home to new people.  We just all know what happens when things don't work. We know the statistics, too. 

Whatever your problems are,  Alaska will not solve them. It magnifies them.  You have to solve them before you come here. That's why the ""I want to move to Alaska!"" posts frequently get...discouraged.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Haines local life,"The more and more I read about what I consider to be the most beautiful place in the USA (Haines, AK), the more questions I have about what kind of people live there and what local life is really like.

I found a blog called [Motes Mountain Chronicles](https://motesmountain.com) 

They went off grid on Chilkat lake and wrote about it for a few years.

It was the perfect reading for me as I had asked about blogs and vlogs on here a couple days ago and instead of any real answers I was told how stupid I was for even being interested in the area.

I found it odd at all of the backlash I received, but as I read further into this couples’ journey I started to pick up some hints of serious small town drama in their lives.

For instance the whole town was apparently reading their blog and would call the police if they read about something they didn’t like.

It’s interesting to think about someone whom you’ve never met reading something you wrote about a hawk attacking you on your remote property—idk—30 miles from the nearest road? And you clipping its foot in a desperate attempt at survival making it all the way to the feds. 

Anyways, all of a sudden this couples blog just abruptly ends and they put their property up for sale 8 or 9 months after not posting.

I might also add that despite the law issues, they really always spoke highly of the people around them including law enforcement. 95% of what they wrote made it seem like they were enjoying themselves and thriving, no serious red flags outside of near death on the river a few times. But they signed up for that. 

Looking through their comments I see a couple people asked them why they decided to sell and they request people email them directly for that info.

That to me is a huge red flag. 

So then I get to digging around Reddit and this AlaskaHermit person has a huge thread around the corrupt nature of Haines without providing any real specifics. They get drowned out as well.

So this town of Haines seems to have a population of 1600 and you’re telling me hundreds of them are on Reddit? Because why would anyone else care what goes on in a small Alaskan town? 

What does progress in Haines actually look like? I’ve lived in small towns in the lower 48 but the stuff I read about w/haines gives off blockbuster movie cliches. Again… a town of 1600? 😂

I tried to do some geology records on the woman the town was named after and it looks like she had quite a few children. Did the family remain in the borough? Is one of them the sheriff? 

I haven’t read the book If You Lived In This Town I’d Know Your Name yet but it’s on the way. 

All of the drama is pretty exciting for an outsider. But I probably won’t be an outsider for too much longer.",2023-09-28 21:34:02
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Thanks for a great vacation!,"My wife and I recently enjoyed a 10-day vacation in Alaska. We had a fantastic time, and pretty much everyone we dealt with (whether local resident or seasonal help) was incredibly nice and helpful. 

Highlights included a trip into the Arctic Circle, a bus tour of Denali, riding on the Alaska Railroad, and a glacier tour of Prince William Sound.

 Everywhere we looked, the landscape was amazing. We were fortunate enough to see all of Denali, which was particularly breathtaking. We also got to see a lot of wildlife and hear a lot of great stories about wildlife encounters. I only wish we had had time to do and see more!

I just wanted to say how much we enjoyed your state, and how much we appreciated everyone we met throughout our trip!

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",M(27) visiting Alaska for work in late March. ,"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",KHNS published some of the best modern Alaskan satire I’ve ever seen this April Fool’s,"This is one of the funniest pieces of local satire I’ve ever read. KHNS has been knocking it out of the park the last year+ or so. (Their election coverage was really A+++ last fall.) Anyway, I’m guessing most Alaskans will enjoy this one, so give it a read if ya have some time. It’s rare we get to congratulate a media outlet for hilarious and creative writing these days—in fact, KHNS here just gave me the first actual proof I have ever seen that any of our “official” Alaskan media sources understand the First Amendment at all. But this? This is the real deal—satire based on actual local events that can make both sides and all bystanders laugh and laugh. Enjoy!",2024-04-04 21:39:53

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Job opportunity with SEARHC in Sitka,"I’m really considering taking this job if I get it.  What should I expect from Sitka. I already am having a tad bit of trouble finding decent rentals that could stay in the budget. Job offer is at 22-26 ish a hour is that enough to be livable in this area..?

Just a small note:

I do get full benefits and a relocation package of like 7.5k. I been seeing a few postings on the housing Facebook page. Dunno if it changes anything….

 my main concerns are still transportation (from city to city. Someone says it’s 30 minutes by plane to and from Juneau but cost wise I don’t wanna pay 100+ for recreational sports which already will be costly.) 

Sitka is apparently too warm for recreation? However I saw someone say it’s not for those who are NOT adventurous. I enjoy hiking, I want to try new things and get out but I do NOT wanna be trapped in doors all day also I suppose to idea of constant rain is also not pleasant to think about.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",need help finding the best jerky I've ever had,"Context: in the summer my partner and I had wonderful trip to Anchorage, long drive down to Homer, and back again. We were in the state for a total of 9 days. I literally, don't like beef jerky - every kind I've ever had from a store has been dry and too salty or not a good flavor (also a teriyaki hater). HOWEVER, wherever we were in Alaska we were able to find some bomb ass jerky that I actually enjoyed, was subtly sweet, and not too too sticky on our fingers. 


But I have a dodongo brain, and cannot for the life of me remember what the brand the jerky was. I remember a few key attributes

- honey was a listed ingredient (but, it Honey wasn't the ""flavor"" name, or anything)
- came in a clear bag with a label slapped on
- it had a black-pepper flavor variety, that I think had the honey ingredient, but I'm not sure
- I'm 99% certain it's not Old Trapper, Tillamook, Jack Links, or anything else you can find on the mainland. This was an Alaskan brand


And that's it. I would love some help finding this because I've searched online for months, and I cannot seem to find this bag/brand of jerky. Much love and thanks to y'all 🙏🙏🙏


EDIT: folks have suggested a few brands, which I am greatly appreciative of their insight. If a picture of ""Three Bears Jerky"" original is posted, with ingredients list I would love that person forever ",2024-01-04 04:35:10

Can you please let me know if it is a bad idea to visit considering the rainy weather and closure of many touristy activities? We are hoping to see the Northern lights but we are travelling to Anchorage. Is it better to travel to Fairbanks instead? ",2023-09-12 20:17:27
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Alaska in April,"Yes, I know, April is melting season in Alaska and it will likely be muddy...but that's the only possible time for us (husband and I) to travel. We would rather prefer to see more snow than greenery on the mountains and are generally laid back travelers mostly seeking good views!

We will be taking a cruise departing from Seward on April 22 so would like to spend a few days enjoying Alaska via land. We will arrive in Anchorage via plane (not booked yet) and need a bit of help planning from there.

1. To get to Seward from Anchorage it seems our only option at that time of year may be the Seward Bus Line? It looks like the Coastal Classic train doesn't run until mid May and I can't seem to find any rental cars that offer one way drop-offs..

2. If the shuttle is the only possibility, would it still be worth renting a car a trying to drive part of the route to Seward for the views? Or a different location to drive to?

3. Is the Aurora winter train trip worth taking from Anchorage to Fairbanks in mid April as the days are already quite long and chances of spotting the lights is low. I.e. are the views on that route worth it? (>$200pp one way is a hefty amount) I understand on a good day you can see mount Denali from the train..is this also possible from the road if we were to rent a car? (since the roads within the park are probably still packed with snow?)

4. Any other recommendations specific for that time of year?

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Planning a Week Long Trip in Alaska - Open to ALL suggestions!,"Hey guys! Not to be that annoying tourist trying to plan a trip but also totally being that guy.

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Four 10-Hour shifts flex plan--State restrictions?,"So currently I work as loss prevention, and enjoy the benefit of a ""FLEXIBLE WORK HOUR PLAN"" which allows me to work 4 days a week, 10 hours a day.  
Recently, due to short staffing at my place of work, I offered to help cover by picking up shifts in another department. It would be overtime, but nobody was bothered.   
Then, upper management informed me I could not, because it would violate the 4x 10's agreement, and they could be fined, because I would be ""regularly scheduled for over 40 hours a week."" Essentially, if I was working five 8-hour shifts at the same company, I could be scheduled (on request) to regularly work an extra day or even every day, and that would be fine.  
If I worked part time at another company, I could do that as well.   
Oh, and so long as it's consensual, I could even work a double or 16-hour shift under five 8's.   
**But I can't work part-time in a different department at my current job, because of normally working four 10-hour shifts, because that's illegal.**  


This is so dumb. It literally makes less than no sense. Is upper management mistaken? If they are not, is there literally any paperwork or legal recourse I can pursue that someone might know of to override that labor law? Keep in mind, **I want to do this.** If I didn't want to, I would just resign. Going back to five 8's isn't an option either due to school restraints. I can't believe I could miss out on thousands of extra dollars because of the worst technicality in a labor law I've ever heard of.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",First Time Alaska Visitors - August Itinerary Feedback,"Hi Everyone! 

Please let me know if this type of post is not welcome on the main page and I'll be happy to re-post in the correct space. I \[27M\] will be visiting Alaska (from Cali) with my parents \[55+\] in late August for 8 full days of activity. It will be our first time there, and so would love to hear some feedback on the current schedule I have laid out! We do have a rental car for the entire duration, and our main focus is to see wildlife, spectacular views, and bonus points if anyone has running trails for myself you'd recommend. Overall, we're still fine-tuning a lot of the finer details such as exact hikes, etc and it seems like we still have a few days where we need to find things to do or are subject to change as we continue fine-tuning the details (such as Day 2/4/7/8). Overall, I'd just like to take any tips or suggestions, and get anyone's take on whether this itinerary seems ambitious, about right, or a bit too little. Any Advice is appreciated, thank you & we're really looking forward to seeing this beautiful state! :) 

Day 1: \[Anchorage to Talkeetna\] Arrive at Anchorage 1am, resting at the airport until car pickup at 5:30am - head into town and grab some breakfast / figure out what to do/see either in Anchorage or nearby. We're open to unique museums, but are pretty well-travelled from an urban perspective. Potentially visit Powerline Pass Trail and hike an hour or two out and back! Drive up to Talkeetna around 11am, lunch at Denali Brewing, walk around and enjoy the small town until End of Day. Another option would be to go straight to Talkeetna and try squeezing in a flight-seeing event. Seems pretty popular but have never done smth like that before...is this activity worth the cost?   


Day 2: \[Talkeetna to Denali\] Leave \~8/9am to Denali. Spend a half day at the park before retiring to the nearby Cabin we have booked. 

&#x200B;

Day 3: \[Denali\] Full day in the park! Miscellaneous hikes/viewpoints/etc. Hoping to do a trail run if there are any recommended. Thinking we do the regular busses for easy on/off access instead of a green tour bus, but open to change!  

&#x200B;

 Day 4: \[Denali to Anchorage\] Transit Day, if there is anything we missed in the parks, don't mind spending 70% of the day back in the park. Drive down to Anchorage & rest after. 

&#x200B;

Day 5: \[Anchorage to Seward\] Leave \~8am: Stop at Girdwood for the Alyeska Tram/Mountain (potential trail run up?) & check out the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center. Random scenic stops along the way to Seward. Relax upon arrival.   


Day 6: \[Kenai Fjords\] - Full Marine Major 8.5 hour boat tour of the park.

&#x200B;

Day 7: \[Kenai Fjords to Anchorage\] - 9/10am: Harding Icefield Trail! I would like to do this full 9.2 mile hike (if it's decently runnable, I can wrap it up within 2-2.5 hours). Parents will do part of the beginning & some easy connecting trails from the parking lot. Grab lunch somewhere and drive back up to Anchorage. 

Day 8: Relax in Anchorage - need to find stuff to do. Get to Airport at 10:00pm.",2023-06-15 15:54:39

We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)?

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",A Poem Welcoming Pete Buttigieg to the Chilkat Valley,"Good morning r/Alaska. I wrote this poem welcoming Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to the Chilkat Valley today for the literary entertainment paper I publish locally—hope you enjoy!

###The Ballad of Chilkoot Pete

Pete, Oh, Pete!  
Transport this rural poem away  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
From a mining town armed to the teeth  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
With $20 million to lure mining concerns  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
A project for the establishment to posture over  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
While they rob and hunt the poor  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
And irrigate their own lawns  
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
With our spilled lifeblood   
Pete, Oh, Pete!  
Do you know where you're visiting?  

Minorities terrorized by hate speech  
Officials paying friends for fake work  

($100,000 of public money to write  
A college paper that sez: “Mining Gud!"")  

Property values criminally re-appraised  
Countless brown bears murdered  

Greenies getting tires slashed  
Monopoly healthcare poisoning the poor  

Police department hunting the autistic  
While drunks split up their possessions  
(And employees get paid in stolen parrots)

An “animal shelter” that robs from the weak  
And gives to themselves and their friends  

An establishment that culls the disabled   
And the unwanted or unliked and unpopular  
(Using public institutions and resources)  

Local non-profits that goad the victims of drunks  
Through a Medicaid wood-chipper purpose built  

For the grisly grist-work of a mining town  
Caught deep in the throes of self-cannibalizaton   

Transport Pete!  
Your $20 million a Trojan’s gift  
As corporatists do $200 million  
In long-term damage  
Fighting over the poisoned pie  
Doled out from and sliced in DC  
Making our officials too lazy  
And indolent   
(And stupid)  
(And far too violent)  
To ever fund a dock themselves   
“Hey—now we can fight over *this*!”  
—both sides of the mine movement  
::sounds of oppression intensify offstage::  

Gone are the days of economics  
And industry  
And conservation  
And work   
(And safety)  
(And health)  
In Haines Alaska  
The talent's been run out  
Intelligence ridiculed to isolation   
Artists put against the wall  
And ethics burned at the stake  

Just drunks and assassins now  
Fighting over cheap baubles   
Thrown by corporatist masters   
Who walk with box wine wobbles   

Transport Pete!  
You bribe the violent and corrupt with candy   
Transport Pete!  
And come for the free press  
Transport Pete!  
But you won't see The Chilkat Pirate  
Transport Pete!  
Nor any of my staff  
Transport Pete!  
Scouring for musketeers and snickers  
Transport Pete!  
Beneath the broken Haines pinata  
Transport Pete!  
From *Mud Bay* we render your free press  
Transport Pete!  
As outlaws safely *outside* of jurisdiction   
Transport Pete!  
And through this valley no eagle shall pass  
Transport Pete!  
Without suffering folkloric interdiction  

So 'ere you go, have a carrot:  
With this tapping on your door  
Not a Raven comes, but a Parrot  
To settle the Eagle’s score  

For with no well earned salmon grasped  
Did Transport Pete darken *our* door  

No, with a corpse-scavenger's  
Black-blooded offal talons  
And rotten breath beak  
Came Transport Pete to play  
A little hide and seek  

Where Robin Hood comes a nocking  
And the Chilkat Valley knows to duck  
For there's no way to stop the mocking  
Of hermits who give no fuck  

History's clocking *you*  
This Pirate knows it well  
Everything I say is true—  
Please enjoy your stay in Hell!",2023-08-16 18:36:53
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,enjoy",Travel approx. 8 days with 3 teens.,"Never been to Alaska. We are hoping to come up from OR for about 8-9 days in late August (Yes, I kow it is last minute) with 16 yr old twins who will be great with a scenic trip and a 14 yr old who won't appreciate it as much. I have always wanted to come to Alaska. I grew up on a farm and my husband is a city boy. I want to make it very memorable and have researched it where I am overwhelmed. I am a planner but with all the area and travel time, I am thinking to narrow down the days and enjoy more activities, etc for my kids. Basically, most itineraries I see about roughly are 2 days in Anchorage, then Talkeetna then Denali a few days and to Palmer and Seward. There are variations of course. I want it to be relaxing and I am fine driving alot but my kids, maybe not so much. We want to see some sites, relax, eat and hit a few museums. I realize this will be just a starter trip and can always come back but I thought I would ask locals. We are semi-active but not hikers by any means. I am thinking fewer towns, maybe a day cruise or something special/exciting for the kids but husband and daughter get sea sick hence did not even consider a cruise which I am not really into anyhow. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I know you get a lot of questions like this but really, I will be grateful for the help. ",2023-07-14 03:29:45

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,dislike",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,dislike",Alaska travel during September,"Hello, we are planning to visit Alaska (4 day trip) during the last week of September this year. We thought of it at the last minute. Can you please let me know if it is a bad idea to visit considering the rainy weather and closure of many touristy activities? We are hoping to see the Northern lights but we are travelling to Anchorage. Is it better to travel to Fairbanks instead? ",2023-09-12 20:17:27
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,dislike",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,dislike",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16

Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Moving to Alaska is not the solution to your problems,"Let's talk about the truth about moving to Alaska. Feel free to disagree, but I'll start here: 
 
1) **Basic cable TV shows about/set in Alaska are not real.** They're 100% fiction. They  exist because the State of Alaska gave huge tax incentives to production companies to make shows here to lure tourists. Think of them as 1970s toy commercials.  

2)  The whole state is suffering from a dangerous shortage of critical services.  You are endangering the life of anyone who has mental health issues by moving them to Alaska, including yourself and your children. *See also* McCandless, Chris, who is not a folk hero here. 

3) When (not if)  anyone you leave behind Outside has a medical emergency, you won't make it there on time.  My mother missed her own mothers' death and both her siblings' funerals because they all died in the winter, when it's 24-36 hours minimum to get to the East Coast, despite having the ability to pay for a same day ticket. (Contrary to popular belief Alaska Airlines does not have to sell you a cheap bereavement fare on a full plane and will not do so. You can expect to spend $1400 RT to get as far as Seattle at times.)  

**You're not going to be the exception to any of this.** 

4) Need housing? There isn't much available. It's all really, really overpriced.  It's very low quality. It may have earthquake damage that isn't obvious. You're not going to be the one who finds the unicorn affordable perfect lakeside cabin with no shitty neighbors on a good road with great internet service. You are much more likely to find yourself trying to pull black mold out of the basement sheetrock in the middle of a November power outage, only to find that your basement was never properly dried in and the studs are rotting out.  

5) Your uncle/grandfather/neighbor down the street made a bundle of cash working on a slime line **40+ years ago.**  Employers haven't had to do that in a long time so they don't.  Salaries haven't kept up with the cost of living like they have other places.  That's why all the housing looks like hell.  

**You aren't going to be the one person who finds a great job that pays more than it would anywhere else, because people who are from here and have the right connections aren't getting those.**

6)  Alaska has never been a ""conservative"" state in the same mold that Alabama claims to be a ""conservative"" (e.g. white percale enthusiast) state.  Right wing social/religious politics are about as popular as a turd in a punchbowl with almost everyone who isn't (a) over 65 or (b) a portly middle aged white guy with a goatee in a Ram pickup. 

This ain't Texas. There are some people who try to pretend otherwise, but: 

**People came to Alaska to get away from that bullshit.**


7) Nobody on this sub is ""gatekeeping"" Alaska.  Nobody wants to see people fail. People want new friends and neighbors they like. Alaskans enjoy introducing their home to new people.  We just all know what happens when things don't work. We know the statistics, too. 

Whatever your problems are,  Alaska will not solve them. It magnifies them.  You have to solve them before you come here. That's why the ""I want to move to Alaska!"" posts frequently get...discouraged.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like","Ever just sit there and think ""wow, I live in Alaska""?","I was born here, lived here 35 years - my whole life - though I was on foreign exchange to Germany for a year in high school.

I have a core memory that contains a feeling I've had many times since it happened. One day as my parents were driving me to the elementary school I went to. I looked at the mountains, as I had many times before, and thought something along the lines of ""Wow. I live in Alaska. Most people view Alaska as a special place, and I live here. The place I live is so different from most people, and so majestic."" I was thinking of people in the US as a whole at the time, rather than globally, and obviously my thoughts were not as verbose, but that was the vibe of them. They happened every time I was on that ride to school, and they regularly happen to this day when I'm outdoors and look at my surroundings. Not every day, but frequent enough.

Ever just bask in the uniqueness of the place we live, no matter how ordinary it is to you? Did anyone else who grew up here have that realization one day, that you're not growing up or living in some generic place, you're in *Alaska*? A place that to my elementary school mind not only was the *only* place I knew, but was also fabled in the readings and teachings I absorbed as a child. It's like one day I connected those dots and haven't been able to shake it since.

When I lived abroad on exchange, that feeling was just amplified. I was absolutely stunned and mindblown by the sights in Germany. Just gazing at ancient buildings in absolute wonder, staring at actual skyscrapers in Frankfurt and feeling smaller than I've ever felt (even more than when viewing a mountain many times bigger, just because the skyscraper is manmade and surrounded by other skyscrapers and tall buildings). So much more, too. 

However, my interactions with the people I encountered solidly reinforced my feeling that my true home was a special place. When I told people where I was from, they always reacted in a special way they didn't do for people from other places. Often something starting with the equivalent of ""oh wow, that's so awesome"" acting like they just ran into someone from a strange and wondrous land. Nothing too extreme, but an obvious acknowledgement that you're not from some typical or expected place - and it's a place they know about and have heard tales of.

I fucking love this state and don't want to live anywhere else, no matter how much I like other places. There's just something about simply being here that is so special. Anyone else feel that?

Just posting this because I felt this feeling and felt like writing about it. I'm not bashing other places - they have their own uniqueness and great qualities, but I just love where we live.",2024-09-27 18:00:24

Since all posts on this topic invariably lead to the same replies, I'll kick it off:

First poster while whine about the article being behind a paywall instead of free like all things in Alaska are supposed to be.

Second poster will advocate an income tax. Someone will reply about how they moved to Alaska specifically to avoid paying income taxes in whatever state they came from, and how half the state earns no income and they'll be damned if only half the state should chip in.

Third poster will stan for a sales tax and the replies will be all about how regressive that is for low income Alaskans, and they'll be damned if the state is going to further add to exorbitant prices out in the bush.

Fourth will be about how we need to cut the budget to 1997 levels since nothing should have increased in price since then.

Number five will invoke the sacred mantle of Jay Hammond to confidently assert that paying PFD checks is the only essential function of state government, because some mumbo jumbo about how Alaskans are owed money forever from the government they voted for because it stole their rights to non-existent minerals on land they do not own.

Reply number six will propose some bizarre alcoholic type bargain where we end the PFD, but only after ""one last payout"" of some absurd amount like $60k.

Number 7 will be some thinly disguised racist rant about how ""these people move here just for the PFD,"" when in reality no one moves here just for the PFD.

Anyone got anything new?

My solution (lest I be accused of offering none) is very simple: end the PFD and use the fund as the rain day solution to pay for public services it was always intended as, and end per-barrel production credits.

The rest of the replies will be histrionics about how ending the PFD handouts is taking food from babies mouths, is stealing, is taxes, is regressive when it is none of those things, just an end to free handouts of money you didn't earn and don't deserve.

I don't have much experience moving such a distance, especially by myself. I moved to Texas after HS and back to Vegas after graduation so that's really it. But to go as far as the \*real\* North.. I don't even know where to begin. How do I figure out housing, job, and other types of expenses (plus the whole moving process in general) with a state I have 0 - 2% knowledge of and is what feels like 2x planets away? Like, do I need a passport to drive there since I would have to go through Canada? Could I take a boat there instead? Or would I even want to take a boat there to begin with..? Sounds stupid but I'm just giving half-ass examples of what I think going about such a decision is going to take.

But again, I have no idea. Alaska in general will be a whole new world (again) for me. Reason why I'd like to settle there, reset my life and forget the past, even if it's just a little. My gut tells me Alaska is that place I'm trying to find. But hey, maybe it will be; maybe it won't be...

What I do believe is that it'll be a place I could start another new chapter in my life. Like, do I want to settle with my current stagnating position, living life so dull and alone one could argue it's a pointless existence..? Maybe the opportunities I've been looking for all these years are here... So, any type of advice is greatly appreciated!

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Fairbanks Animal Shelter has so many dogs for adoption!! 🐕🦮🐩🐕‍🦺,"“The Fairbanks North Star Borough Animal Shelter is at capacity for dogs, with limited options for those that can’t be adopted out quickly.

Earlier this week, a chorus of barks and cries coming from dogs looking for new homes filled the shelter’s kennel rooms. The facility is seeing at least twice as many dogs being dropped off as adopted out, said shelter operations supervisor Kimberly Imbert.

“Because people have job changes. They have unforeseen lifestyle changes. Those are the two big reasons that we’re seeing dogs coming in,” she said.

Imbert said the situation is unusual but in line with a national trend. She said the number of dogs surrendered at the borough shelter currently exceeds the indoor kennel capacity allotted for them.

“We pick the number 26 because that leaves enough open kennels so that we can take in strays, and we have 40 dogs indoors right now, so we are completely full,” she said.

The shelter also has a fenced outdoor area with dog houses and tethers, but Imbert said for safety reasons that’s only for dogs accustomed to being tied out. She said when capacity is tight the shelter has to make tough decisions about which dogs are more likely to be adopted.

“We have to look at their health, if they are spayed and neutered and their temperament,” she said. “And then when we are this full, there’s only a certain amount of surgeries that can generally be done in a day by our shelter veterinarian, so then we’re looking at who our fast-track adoption candidates, because if we can get those spayed and neutered first, they can move out of here quicker.”

Imbert said the shelter aims to find homes for all the dogs and there’s also the possibility of transfer to an animal rescue group or finding a foster home, but a grim reality comes into play.

“Euthanasia is the most efficient way to make space, because putting a dog in foster takes time and if one dog comes in we can take that time,” she said. “If five dogs come in, we’re in a bind.”

Imbert encouraged people to try the borough’s online “Home to Home” platform to re-home their dogs before bringing them to the shelter.

“Ideally you would plan ahead and try to re-home your animal yourself, because we only want to be here for the animals that truly, truly need us,” she said.

She also noted that adoption rates at the shelter fluctuate and she’s optimistic that they will pick up, emphasizing that the process is fairly simple, and starts with making an appointment.

“But we do accept walk-ins when there’s availability, so you come in, you visit with the animals, the care staff goes over everything we know about the animal, and we go over any care instructions that we have,” she said. “If they’ve just had spay or neuter surgery, they may need special care for two weeks. And then, at that point, if you decide to adopt the animal, you go to the front desk, you show them your ID, pay the adoption fee, sign an agreement and you go home with your animal.”

Imbert said the shelter is offering half-off adoption fees for all animals this week.”

1989? Kodiak Island. Wife and I are hunting out on Narrow Cape and Kelsin Bay. She gets a nice doe. Its in the bed of our black and silver Jeep Comanche pickup that has a white topper.  On the way home we swing down the road to Saltery Cove to see if I can find a deer.  We are a few hundred yards from the truck..... and both get the feeling we are being watched.  It's spooky. We go back to the truck.... she spotted a little blood dripping from the bed. As we leave the place where we parked another truck arrives - same size as ours, and also black and silver with a white top and parks where we did.  Two days later on the front page of the Kodiak Daily Mirror is a picture of that truck, the owner, and Mr. Sweeny from Sweeny Insurance Agency.  Seems the owner walked off to do some fishing and when he came back - his truck was totally beat to shit by a bear!  It had scraped the paint job all over, ripped off trim, the topper was ruined - big chew marks in it........ and the owner was at a total loss of words.  I remember the paper quoted him as saying, ""There was nothing in the truck. Not even a sandwich. I have no idea why a bear would do this.""  And then quote from his insurance agent, ""I've never had to process a claim like this in my whole career.""

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Haines local life,"The more and more I read about what I consider to be the most beautiful place in the USA (Haines, AK), the more questions I have about what kind of people live there and what local life is really like.

I found a blog called [Motes Mountain Chronicles](https://motesmountain.com) 

They went off grid on Chilkat lake and wrote about it for a few years.

It was the perfect reading for me as I had asked about blogs and vlogs on here a couple days ago and instead of any real answers I was told how stupid I was for even being interested in the area.

I found it odd at all of the backlash I received, but as I read further into this couples’ journey I started to pick up some hints of serious small town drama in their lives.

For instance the whole town was apparently reading their blog and would call the police if they read about something they didn’t like.

It’s interesting to think about someone whom you’ve never met reading something you wrote about a hawk attacking you on your remote property—idk—30 miles from the nearest road? And you clipping its foot in a desperate attempt at survival making it all the way to the feds. 

Anyways, all of a sudden this couples blog just abruptly ends and they put their property up for sale 8 or 9 months after not posting.

I might also add that despite the law issues, they really always spoke highly of the people around them including law enforcement. 95% of what they wrote made it seem like they were enjoying themselves and thriving, no serious red flags outside of near death on the river a few times. But they signed up for that. 

Looking through their comments I see a couple people asked them why they decided to sell and they request people email them directly for that info.

That to me is a huge red flag. 

So then I get to digging around Reddit and this AlaskaHermit person has a huge thread around the corrupt nature of Haines without providing any real specifics. They get drowned out as well.

So this town of Haines seems to have a population of 1600 and you’re telling me hundreds of them are on Reddit? Because why would anyone else care what goes on in a small Alaskan town? 

What does progress in Haines actually look like? I’ve lived in small towns in the lower 48 but the stuff I read about w/haines gives off blockbuster movie cliches. Again… a town of 1600? 😂

I tried to do some geology records on the woman the town was named after and it looks like she had quite a few children. Did the family remain in the borough? Is one of them the sheriff? 

I haven’t read the book If You Lived In This Town I’d Know Your Name yet but it’s on the way. 

All of the drama is pretty exciting for an outsider. But I probably won’t be an outsider for too much longer.",2023-09-28 21:34:02

I guess I’m curious if there’s anything that wouldn’t be $250/ night to rent? Push comes to shove I’ll change my tickets and just come for the night of the movie. 

I’m coming from anchorage so Alaskan weather isn’t the concern, it’s a lack of experience in an unknown climate, specifically predators. Genuinely looking for ideas, don’t need judgement though. I know I’m behind af on housing for this trip. Fucked up and trying to make it work. And yes I tried google already, not much luck. TIA ! ",2024-06-29 01:05:13

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Help a guy out...,"**\*\*\*UPDATE – Replacement Mug On The Way – Mission Accomplished\*\*\***

First,  thank you to all of you for your suggestions, responses, and offers to  help. Seeing such an outpouring like this has been awesome. Alaskans…  you’ve outdone yourself with generosity and kindness. Thank you. Thank  you. Thank you.

We’ve had over a  dozen folks offer to go and find a matching mug at the various stores in  their area. We’ve had some ( Beercruiser0, goosfrabba, and  throwawayadditionalslice ) that were doing “forensic research” and found  a picture on a Facebook page of a store with the mug in the picture! If  you get a chance - go check out Ben Franklin Store in Juneau. (How they  found THAT mug in the picture…amazing).

Still, others suggest Kintsugi, which was a “down the rabbit hole” research activity for me since I’d never heard of it.

I  even exchanged some notes with the President and CEO of the local  visitor’s bureau. She was very interested in seeing this through  (thanks, lizperry1).

So cool to see online communities and literal communities come together to help like this.

After  posting the situation, we did find the name of the store and contact  information of where we bought the original mug. Through that process,  we contacted Tamala and Alex from Alaska Shirt Company in Juneau  (Another great place to visit and support if you’re in Juneau – they  were Rock Stars). As I’m typing this update, the email just came through  with the tracking number for the order.

So,  in 3-5 business days, with your help and support, I should be able to  hand my wife a replacement mug (hopefully, I won’t drop it when I hand  it to her).  
Thank you all for your help, kind words, and investment  of time to track this down. There can be a lot of meanness and ugliness  in the world. This was not an example of that. You’ve all demonstrated  some of the qualities that represent the very best of us.

Cheers to you all!

My wife and I recently returned from an Alaskan cruise to celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary. During the cruise, we had stops in Juneau, Skagway, and Ketchikan. At one of the stops, my wife found a coffee mug she really liked. I don't remember which store we bought it at, otherwise, I'd contact them directly.

While emptying the dishwasher yesterday, I dropped it. I feel terrible. She says it's not a big deal... It is. I've tried to find it with Google Lens, Amazon, Ebay... no success.

I'm coming to this forum hoping someone can help me out and direct me to where/how I can buy a replacement for her. I've attached images of the (broken) mug for reference. Any help you can offer will be a huge help and greatly appreciated.

IF, by chance, you live in Alaska and can find and purchase this mug, I'd be more than happy (thrilled, really) to work out those details with you to pay you back.

The mug:

* Cream color with a taup(ish), two-tone color along the bottom portion of the mug.
* On the front of the mug, it says ""Alaska -EST. 1959-"" with a tree, bear, and stars in the sky.
* On the inside of the mug, it has a bear claw towards the top rim.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Electric vs. GPS fences for dogs in Alaska,"I've got a small farm and a large livestock guardian dog who loves to run off the fox, coyotes, porcupines, moose, bears, all of it.  However, I live a few hundred yards from the highway, am on a river, and have the train tracks bordering one side of the property.  I NEED to keep the dog off the tracks.  We have a few acres so a buried fence wouldn't be the best option.  I'm also unsure of how they would work with deep snow.

Does anyone know if GPS collars work without direct supervision?   I have tried a Petsafe perimeter unit that works with a slightly customizable circumference but it did not help as our land is narrow not wide and allowed the tracks into the safezone.   I was also worried about the dog crossing the line, getting shocked, and not being able to come back without being shocked.  When he chases or tracks something, he goes wholeheartedly at fullspeed.  I currently have a Tractive collar that notifies my phone within two minutes when he goes out of my customized area, but I can't rely on it when I am not home and have been tying him up to be safe when I leave.  

Dogs get hit by the train all the time - they don't seem to realize that it's gonna kill them.  Does anyone have any recommendations to help me keep my animals alive?  Fences are out - the electric ones tangle up the moose and regular fences go under the snow.  He keeps the livestock protected and I'd like to protect him by keeping him from dangers that he doesn't realize are there.  I have the time and love to have training time with him, I just can't seem to get him to respect the boundaries of the property.  We walk the borders every day at least once, if not twice.  Thanks for your time everybody!

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Vanning it for College in Anchorage,"I'm hoping to be attending University of Alaska Anchorage starting next fall. I've been living out of a van for 4 years (including wintering through at ski resorts in Washington). So I'm comfortable in the cold with my setup, having experienced the struggle of -20 degree nights, and cold days with little to no sun. The intention however, is to do long-term stays Fall-Spring at RV parks (I've found 3 already, right near the University that would be open for that kind of stay).   


I suppose my questions are these: during winter, how are the roads within Anchorage? I assume that like mountain towns in WA, they'd have pretty good road clearing systems. Are power outages common? This could come as a heavy hit if it's longer than a few days in a van that's generally staying hooked up all the time. What types of communal areas are generally available during the winter? Are places like coffee shops and libraries where you can hang out and study without being on campus fairly common? And any other comments you might have that may be helpful. Just for clarification purposes though, bear in mind - I am comfortably familiar with living out of a van in harsh winter conditions. Looking at record highs and lows, and average highs and lows and snow fall amounts - what's up there seems to be pretty well within the same parameters I usually operate in during the winter when living at ski resorts for the winter in the van.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Overcoming Nostalgia ,"My family and I moved away from AK over 7 years ago when I was just 11 years old... but as each year passes and the more l've grown up and come of age living in California, the harder and more homesick I get for Alaska. It's become so bad to the point where not a day goes by when I don't start reminiscing and thinking back to growing up in such a beautiful place.
For context, I was born in Fairbanks and my family and I moved a lot across AK, mainly in small villages (only accessible by bush plane) across Central and Northern Alaska. It was so hard for us to live, but now when I look back I only see the positives.

I know it's not the most ideal state for living, and I remember when I was actually growing up there I really hated it. I hated living in Alaska as a kid because it felt so isolating and lonely and obviously very cold, and it was difficult for my parents to provide for my siblings and I and I could see the toll it took on them to work and live in quite literally the middle of nowhere.

I think I've just grown bitter about living in the Bay Area and am sick of the cost of living and sheer volume of people that live here, and l've also grown fearful that living in the Bay has made me lose my identity as an Alaskan and lose a lot of the qualities I like to think Alaskans have like resilience and grit and toughness. Or maybe I just miss being a kid, like most people. My family and l often discuss wanting to go back to Anchorage or Fairbanks just for a visit, but it's never come to fruition because of how
expensive a trip would be. I honestly don't want to go back to living in Alaska, but it's been over 7 years since l've left and I just want to return back to the place where I was born and raised even just for a little bit. Sorry for the venting, I just wasn't sure where else to put this.",2024-10-04 06:11:45
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",NYC to Cooper Landing,"I’ll possibly be moving to the area for work in the next few months.

What does moving to Alaska from somewhere like NYC look like? Especially as a single 30 year old. A little nervous about the adjustment in lifestyle. The whole population of CP is how many people live on my block rn 🤣

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24

However I noticed two other distinct groups of people. First were the 20 somethings that seem to move out there just for the fun and adventure, can only assume that over time they'll eventually move back to wherever they came from. But the second group seems even larger,  these people  who seem to move there. Those who just wanted to run away from their families and problems in the lower 48. Many of them want to pretend that they're mountain men or women like some modern day Jeremiah Johnson. Myself I grew up living in the mountains so when I see some of these people talk about life up there, I know that they're running their mouths, talking it up for the tourists. I heard a few tales about wrestling with bears everyday, trading with the natives and so on. I just had to roll my eyes.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Not sure i''ll ever get used to $79/day + taxes/fees for the cheapest rental car you can find during the summer,"gonna start by saying that in 2012 when i went to AK, iit was spectacular to say the least. that trip (august 1-7), i rented an SUV last minute for $367 for a week. side note: a room on JBER was also $33/night OTD & actually, i rented a small apartment for $33/night and did two nights there. now, single rooms are like $120+

anyways, since then, rental car cost has been going up steadily and last time i went in 2020, i think it was about $525/week for a small economy car.

now? the absolute cheapest i can find *anything* is $79/day on turo ($101/day with taxes and fees) and on orbitz, forget it. the cheapest anything is $939/week or $148/day with taxes and fees. i try to go for 10-11 days and it's coming out to about $1,630 or thereabouts.

i used to be able to fly and rent a car there for $1,200 or under for a 10-11 day trip but now, it seems that isn't happening for less than $2,000 and as much as i want to visit again, $2k for what used to be $1,200 four years ago is about where i draw the line.

so i guess unless i start making a TON of money, im not going back anytime soon.

only other thing i can think of is if people could ride-share so meetup in ANC and take the car to Seward for a few days then somewhere else etc.

i guess this was just a rant. it is sad all around in my opinion as i used to consider alaska to be a place even a middle-class person could experience but now, i dont think it is. still the most gorgeous place ive ever seen.",2023-12-29 02:14:15
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",I want to visit,"Hey Alaskans, 

I want to visit for the summer with 2 friends looking at how to get up there I’m living in WA and want to know if anyone has done something similar. 

I want to get a job with my friends I don’t care what. (Hauling fishing to pulling oil to stacking shelf’s) a nice little house not to expensive I want to live there for 3-4 months. 

My current questions and I know I have more I haven’t thought of yes

How should I find the place to stay? 
Airbnb doesn’t seems good with long stays like that I don’t want a hotel to be honest I would like my own kitchen. 

Where is everything? 
I have no idea where anything is where I should plan to stay to see the Alaskan lands. 

How should I get there? 
I have heard about a boat which would be cool living on a boat for a couple days on the way there, driving I wouldn’t mind sub question where do I stop along the way?

How much should I save up? 
I’m 19 years old so I don’t know this type of stuff honestly looking to have a fun time with my friends and do something I won’t do when I’m old and have a job. 

Let me know other things to I have just started thinking about this and need a plan! Thanks all!! 

See you soon! ",2024-03-05 07:49:32
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Bringing mainland stuff to Alaska?,"So something I've done ever since I was young anytime I traveled far away I would try to buy an even sell or trade with where I was going. Coming to Alaska and I might want to get myself a totem and maybe some other goodies, but I was wondering if there were things that people up there would love to pickup? I know the internet has changed this for the most part, but thinking when I went to Hawaii (post internet),I brought Dr Pepper, Twinkies, ding dongs and I even brought some blue jeans to a friend of mine. He mentioned that if I packed a suitcase full of that stuff, that other people would be interested. I did it and the stuff didn't last 20 minutes some of the neighbors and passerbys cleaned me out.
 
At first it seemed a little weird, but I've done this in different states and countries. Not that I'm going to sit there and pack an entire suitcase full of Twinkies and ding dongs, but I thought it'd be nice to bring a couple of items. (Even as tip or a little thank you). I grew up in a relatively isolated area so I know what it's like trying to get stuff imported. This time's a little weird because I don't know anybody that lives there, but, in the past I've always had good luck with making a deal and/or making someone's day. Any thoughts or advice is greatly appreciated :-)",2024-05-01 21:58:41
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",So I’m going to be visiting Alaska in the next 11 days and I’m just wondering what would be some must buy souvenirs and gifts or etc?,"First off just want to say sorry if this isn’t aloud here I didn’t know where else to go to ask this haha. 

Secondly, as the title says I’m finally going to be visiting Alaska and I can’t wait! I’ll be there for 11 days. My parents and I are doing a land and cruise tour. So will be on land for about 3 days(will be in Denali and in MT McKinley). After that will be starting our cruise in Anchorage(Whittier), that’s where we will be embarking from. The next places will be costing on the cruise are: Hubbar Glacier, Glacier Bay National Park, Skagway, Juneau and lastly Ketchikan. So I’m just wondering what would be some once in a lifetime must have buy souvenirs, gifts, and etc to get myself? 

Alittle bit about me….I love the outdoors, love nature, and love to swim. I also like beer(sometimes), all kinds of foods, sweets, pastries and root beer haha. I wouldn’t mind some clothing(winter to be exact but all other kinds are fine as well).",2023-07-18 13:39:48
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Winter Clothes for Northern Alaska,"Hi there, I am visiting Utqiagvik/Barrow and wonder if someone who has time and patience would be willing to let me know what type of clothes I ought to buy.

I am especially interested in stuff that will save money too if that is possible, as I realize buying name brand stuff can cost thousand(s).

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",What are the basic differences in day-to-day life in the major Alaskan cities/towns?,"To elaborate a little more on what I'm asking, I'm considering moving to Alaska, but generally in an abstract sense, (I'm currently too young to initiate such a move). Its something I'm very interested in doing when I have the ability, but overall its not something I'm directly initiating yet. 

However, I'm quite interested in life in the state and its various population centers. Specifically, I'm wondering how life is different in different population centers like Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, and even smaller towns like Ketchikan, Kodiak, Nome, Barrow, Dutch Harbor, etc. I'm aware of the basics (further north = colder, Anchorage = big city, Fairbanks and Juneau = small cities, everything else = town). But I'm wondering what the more day-to-day small scale differences are in living in one community compared to another.

Side note, yes I'm aware that this sub is probably loaded with moving questions, sry for the clutter lol.",2023-09-25 19:06:30
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",California to Sitka,"Hello everyone,

I am doing seasonal work in Alaska, either in Sitka or Haines. Most likely Sitka because there I received offer letters and I still am in the interview process for the position in Haines. 

The job I am preparing to plan for is Sitka for now, one does offer free bunkhouses for staff.

The other jobs are slightly more remote where I'd be working and staying in a no water cabin with and without people during the work week but will be on my own outside of work for living situation eg. probably not a lot of days off but maybe one to two days. All the jobs will roughly start and end from May - November.

SO my initial plan was to bring up my car (2013 honda CRV all-wheel-drive) and I currently have it situated for living out of (I've lived in my car before). My car is kind of my safety net allows me my more personal freedoms, and I was really hoping to bring it up with me to Sitka or Haines ultimately so I don't have to pay for any housing because I am still paying for housing here in California, where me and my boyfriend currently live. 

At least if I did get the position in Haines then there's a driving route through Canada but I am still trying to figure out calculating amount of days it would take versus the time they want me to start, mileage on my poor car, and gas money. I was highly considering the marine highway ferry system for the position I got offered in Sitka but looks pretty expensive and limited, confusing enough I will have to talk to a person to figure out what times are actually available... but it already looked like an 1800$ trip with multiple port stops --> charging each at 210$??? No direct routes because limited ferry times not enough resources to run more ferries but there's at least 6 different stops.... before Sitka. ouch. I think only one ferry id available to stop at Sitka in May. But, it would be nice because then I drive up from the San Jose area of California, to Bellingham and take the ferry with my car, just sit on the ferry for 4 days then end up in Sitka with less miles and wear and tear on my car than going through canada to haines... IDK flying seems definitely cheaper. But then I'm at the mercy of my work for housing, which so far sounds fine in Sitka but I like to have a backup or be able to rely on myself and my car would offer that safety net. 

Sorry for the long post! Let me know if you have any advice or experience trying to bring your car up/roadtrip from California to southeast Alaska, traveling for seasonal work, any driving routes you've taken from mainland up the the panhandle if there are any. Are there maybe anymore ports I could drive to before Sitka that might have more availability or a more direct routes to Sitka? I was hoping to ferry from Bellingham -> ketchikan --> Juneau --> Sitka 

but in reality its --> Bellingham -->ketchikan --> Wrangell --> Petersburg --> juneau --> haines --> skagway --> haines --> Juneau --> then finally Sitka (4 days total after bellingham)",2024-04-19 18:06:09

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

The wrench in this plan is my ADHD medication. I take Adderall for ADHD and have done so for years. My Colorado psychiatrist cannot send a prescription for a controlled substance out-of-state, and Colorado's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program only allows for dispensing 30 days of a controlled substance at a time. I'm specifying that because regulations seem to vary wildly by state - when I was moving across the country, my psychiatrist in North Carolina handed me 3 months' worth of physical prescriptions, which I could then give to a pharmacy anywhere I wanted.

So, I'm hoping someone here has experience with getting ADHD medication in Alaska.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Alaska is having its first conference on psychedelic medicine this summer!,"Hello fellow Alaskans,

The first psychedelic conference in Alaska, Arctic Visions Psychedelic Conference, is happening in Anchorage on August 23rd and 24th, 2024. The Alaska Task Force for the Regulation of Psychedelic Medicines was recently established by the House of Representatives in order to study how to license and regulate psychedelic-assisted therapy in the event of upcoming federal approval of substances such as MDMA and psilocybin. Furthermore, future state legislation decriminalizing psychedelic substances for personal and therapeutic use will potentially be upcoming in the state as evidenced by legislation such as the Natural Medicine Act in Colorado. Over the two days of this conference, attendees will engage in discussions, workshops and sessions led by a variety of local, regional and national experts in the field from clinical, academic and research-based disciplines. There have been some barriers in advertising this conference due to anxieties surrounding potential FCC violations as a result of the subject matter, which has been incredibly unfortunate. Psychedelic medicine is a serious topic and access to information, as well as the opportunity to ask questions should be made available to anyone in Alaska who'd like to learn about them. Please follow this link to learn more about the conference, and scroll to the bottom of the page for ticket information. There are partial and full scholarship opportunities available for people unable to attend the conference due to financial constraints. Early registration and scholarship pricing is available until June 1st: [https://arctic-visions.com/](https://arctic-visions.com/). Thank you!",2024-05-27 03:59:35
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Best way to thaw an engine? ,Car sat outside unplugged for a few weeks waiting g to be repaired. Even during that -40°/-50° weather. We have since repaired it and replaced the battery with a brand new one. She acts like she wants to crank but doesn't. The battery is fine and everything else in the car is working. We have had it plugged in for 2 days now and still not cranking. What's a good way to heat her up so the oil is flowing and she cranks? Not really looking for people that want to charge to do it... looking to learn how to do it myself just in case something like this happens again.  Thanks in advance for any advice. ,2024-02-18 23:04:40

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,annoying",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Can you please let me know if it is a bad idea to visit considering the rainy weather and closure of many touristy activities? We are hoping to see the Northern lights but we are travelling to Anchorage. Is it better to travel to Fairbanks instead? ",2023-09-12 20:17:27
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,annoying",Planning a Week Long Trip in Alaska - Open to ALL suggestions!,"Hey guys! Not to be that annoying tourist trying to plan a trip but also totally being that guy.

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,annoying",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,annoying",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

They are wearing a tracker. They are about thirteen miles out from Bethel, in the swamplands, and developing hypothermia. Per texts from their immediate family, due to the high winds today, rescuers cannot reach them. I am states away and feeling really helpless and powerless. 

No other family members are in Alaska at this time. Does Bethel have any other options for rescue besides air rescue? Will they/can they hike after him or send rescue dogs? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Please be kind, I don’t know much about Alaska. Thank you.  

Edit: Just heard from them directly. They’re hiking back, hypothermia symptoms are mild right now and they know how to handle the symptoms. The way others were wording it, it came across as if they were dying in a ditch somewhere, so I’m relieved to hear the situation is not that serious. Thank you for all the suggestions. 

Edit 2: He’s still wet and cold and exhausted, but does not want to ask for help or press his panic button. He started hiking back but it took him two days to go the 13 miles and now he’s not feeling well so instead he’s hunkered down for the night. I’m worried for him but we’ll see what happens. 

Final Edit: he was rescued & hospitalized but is safe and is going to be okay. Thanks to the people on this post, your suggestions and phone numbers helped us get him help in time. I really appreciate all of the helpful people on here! ",2024-07-26 14:18:52
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",Need Legal Help: Pet Sitting Gone Wrong,"Hi everyone. I'll try to keep this as concise as possible. My fiance and I are in a a bit of a sticky situation.

We agreed to pet sit for a friend's 2 dogs via text, as he was moving somewhere that would not allow his dogs. He told us he would be working to find another place to live. However he did not tell us that we would also be taking care of the females seven 4 week old puppies as well until he showed up at our door with them. We tentatively accepted, told him we'd trial it for a few days and go from there.

We agreed with him via text on $1200 a week + expenses (food, toys, etc to bw delivered every saturday. Worth noting that all he showed up with was 1 towel, 3 kennels, and a bag of food for the adults). This was on 10/19.

He has now ghosted us on multiple occasions with various stories about losing his phone (twice), his car getting broken into, losing his keys,  etc, and he has yet to come over and pay us anything or see his animals. We have told him multiple times we can no longer care for these dogs and they need to go to a shelter so they can be taken care of properly if he cannot care for them. He told us he was going to buy an RV/build a heated shed for them to live in, and we told him that would not be appropriate for the puppies, as they need near constant monitoring. He agreed to call a shelter but never followed through to our knowledge.

As of today, Sunday, we have not heard from him since Thursday. A friend of ours reached him through his current roommate and told us he would come over on Saturday (yesterday) and never showed. He has been ignoring our texts and sending calls to voicemail. My fiance texted him this morning and told him we would be taking him to small claims.

My questions is, can we legally take the dogs to a shelter? We just can't take care of these animals anymore, between the costs and our very basic knowledge of training, these dogs need people who know what they're doing. We are already out probably around $500 in expenses which we just can't afford. I'm worried if we take them somewhere and tell them they're not technically our dogs, they will turn us away and we'll just be going in circles. I also don't want to lie and say they are our dogs.

I contacted Alaska Dog and Puppy Rescue twice to see if they're taking surrenders and they never responded to me. I looked on animal controls website and technically the owner hasn't abandoned them.  All the forms for shelters ask that you confirm the dog you are surrendering is your dog. I'm just so confused, stressed, and feel totally lost. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",2024-11-03 21:26:23
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",Moving to Alaska but unsure of how to get out of car note :(,"Hi!

I received an incredible job offer that involves me moving to Alaska from Louisiana post grad. The issue is I bought a Toyota Camry 2021 & I still have about $23k left to pay on it. It has around 43,000 miles & I just recently got three brand new tires on it. I’m unsure of what to do with my car. Another problem is that for the past six months, I’ve been doing an unpaid internship so that I can graduate with my masters degree (medical field) so I would really like to make some money so that I can purchase a car in Alaska. I’m unsure of what the best option is for me. Would I be able to trade my car in and get a car of the same value in Alaska. I’m worried that no one will by my car for more than $23k so I can have money left over to buy another used car in Alaska. Help??

Edited: Thanks so much for all the helpful advice! it’s my first time really even being on Reddit so I wasn’t expecting the rude comments lol. I honestly wasn’t expecting a comment at all! Anyways, thanks to the ones that could help! I’ll leave this up for anyone that may need this one day! :) ",2023-10-29 03:43:31

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",Electric vs. GPS fences for dogs in Alaska,"I've got a small farm and a large livestock guardian dog who loves to run off the fox, coyotes, porcupines, moose, bears, all of it.  However, I live a few hundred yards from the highway, am on a river, and have the train tracks bordering one side of the property.  I NEED to keep the dog off the tracks.  We have a few acres so a buried fence wouldn't be the best option.  I'm also unsure of how they would work with deep snow.

Does anyone know if GPS collars work without direct supervision?   I have tried a Petsafe perimeter unit that works with a slightly customizable circumference but it did not help as our land is narrow not wide and allowed the tracks into the safezone.   I was also worried about the dog crossing the line, getting shocked, and not being able to come back without being shocked.  When he chases or tracks something, he goes wholeheartedly at fullspeed.  I currently have a Tractive collar that notifies my phone within two minutes when he goes out of my customized area, but I can't rely on it when I am not home and have been tying him up to be safe when I leave.  

Dogs get hit by the train all the time - they don't seem to realize that it's gonna kill them.  Does anyone have any recommendations to help me keep my animals alive?  Fences are out - the electric ones tangle up the moose and regular fences go under the snow.  He keeps the livestock protected and I'd like to protect him by keeping him from dangers that he doesn't realize are there.  I have the time and love to have training time with him, I just can't seem to get him to respect the boundaries of the property.  We walk the borders every day at least once, if not twice.  Thanks for your time everybody!

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

- The employees are asking for CPI wage increases and the company promised 75% contributions to family healthcare.

That's it.

- The company receives a CPI increase from the Borough each year.

The borough has the ability to enforce various fines and penalties, but are actively refusing to do so. Some examples:

- 125% penalty on payment for missed bus runs. For example, if the borough pays $100 for a bus run and company misses it, the company doesn't get paid/gets penalized a total of $125. Or $25 penalty on top of the missed run.
- $50/person for each person who misses safety meetings. The company is simply not holding any safety meetings at all.
- $25/day/bus for incorrect route numbers. Of which there should be 3 - one on each side and one on the rear. 

The problems aren't only just procedural.

- There are no check rides being done. Shouldn't you be able to trust that your kids are being taken care of by safe drivers?
- There is a bare minimum of maintenance being done. 35% of the buses routinely fail their safety inspections.
- lack of chains

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",Mat-Su school district investigated teachers over student-led protest,"The Mat-Su school board is a bunch of fragile adults. Never before seen a bigger group of cowards masquerading as authoritarians.  When a duly appointed teenager serving as a student representative on the school board is threatening to a majority of adults on the board, it may be time to change the composition of the board. Also, with stunts like this, why would any good teacher want to work in the valley? I know, I know, this is a feature, not a bug. 

[Article here](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2023/10/16/mat-su-district-investigated-teachers-over-student-led-school-board-protests/)

Here's the text: 

PALMER — Students and staff at two Mat-Su high schools say they were questioned by administrators as part of a district-level investigation into a student-led protest at a contentious early September school board meeting.

The protest was centered on a [school board vote last month](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2023/09/07/mat-su-school-board-sharply-limits-role-of-its-student-representative/) to restrict the ability of a sole student representative to participate in public meetings.

The investigation sought to reveal whether teachers had violated a Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District policy banning them from participating in activism at school or politically influencing students, district officials confirmed this week.

It involved more than two dozen students who described being individually questioned by school administrators, as well as at least three teachers, according to interviews with students and staff.

No inappropriate actions by staff were uncovered during the investigation, according to a statement provided by district spokesperson Jillian Morrissey.

The district statement said that members of the school board requested the inquiry, but Morrissey provided no additional information.

Students interviewed for this story said the investigation began a few days after a Sept. 6 school board meeting where the board voted 5-2 to dramatically limit the role of the board’s student representative.

About 10 students spoke in protest of the policy change, while dozens of others attended in protest. Dressed in yellow, students waved small, colorful “Stand for Students” signs taped to paint stirring sticks and lined up to testify against the proposal.

An estimated 30 students at both Wasilla High School and Mat-Su Career & Technical High School were pulled from class or called between periods by school administration staff on the days of Sept. 8 and 11, students and teachers said. They were asked whether any teacher directed or encouraged them to protest and whether instructional time or school supplies were used to create protest materials, such as signage.

At least three teachers who serve as student government advisers — two at Career & Tech and one at Wasilla — were also directly questioned about their influence and any school-funded support, students and staff said.

But protesting at the meeting was entirely the students’ idea, people interviewed for this story told the Daily News.

By questioning whether students were directed to protest by school staff, the board is suggesting students don’t think for themselves, said Quin Schachle, a Wasilla High School senior who is president of both his school’s student government and the districtwide Student Advisory Board’s executive team.

“It felt like that was them taking credit for what I had written and those that I sat down and spent an hour writing that speech,” Schachle said. “It felt really dehumanizing to not be able to have credit for everything that I’ve worked on here.”

A number of school board members did not respond to requests for comment including Ted Swanson and vice president Jubilee Underwood, who voted against the student representative changes; member Kathy McCollum, who voted for the change but said she wants to see more student voice participation; and school board president Tom Bergey.

The Mat-Su school board’s decision to limit the authority of its student representative is the subject of a resolution unanimously approved last weekend by students at the Alaska Association of Student Government fall conference in Fairbanks. The resolution affirms full student representation on school boards statewide.

The school district’s investigation last month involved a [school board policy](https://go.boarddocs.com/ak/matsu/Board.nsf/goto?open&id=C67RJ46E2B80) involving political activities of employees first approved in 1995 and revised in June, officials said.

The investigation began after school board members “heard from constituents about the possible misuse of school resources and reported advocacy about controversial issues occurring by staff” to district administration, according to the statement emailed by Morrissey.

**“**Concerns like this are routinely investigated,” the district statement said. “Although we do not discuss the details of staff or student investigations, we can broadly report that the investigation showed that there was no significant misuse of school resources and that staff actions were appropriate.”

Teachers who said they were questioned included Barbara Jackson, a social studies teacher and student government adviser at Career & Tech; Kristin Shea, a Career & Tech social studies teacher who serves as teacher adviser to the district-wide Mat-Su’s Student Advisory Board executive members; and Karli Rauchenstein, who teaches social studies and advises the student government at Wasilla High School.

News of the questioning created a culture of fear among students at Career & Tech even though they had done nothing wrong, Jackson said this week. When a group of students learned they would be questioned individually, they appeared panicked, she said.

“I did see these looks like ‘Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,’” Jackson said. “And I was like, ‘Guys, you know you are fine, right? You don’t even worry about this for yourself.’”

The investigation was conducted by an assistant principal at Wasilla High School and Career & Tech principal Jason Ross, students and teachers said. Wasilla principal Jason Marvel was not in the building when the investigation was ordered by district staff, students and teachers said.

Both Ross and Marvel declined to comment, citing a district requirement that they refer media questions to the school district public affairs office.

The school board’s current student representative is Ben Kolendo, a senior at Career & Tech High School.

Kolendo this week said the idea for the Sept. 6 student-led protest at the Mat-Su school board meeting initially came from the Career & Tech student government members, who are his friends and support him in his role on the school board.

Until September, the student representative — designated a “board member” by district policy — regularly sat on the dais with other members during meetings and was permitted to fully participate in all but executive sessions, to include questioning witnesses.

But after a May meeting when Kolendo challenged the school board’s selection process for [members of a library book review panel](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2023/05/25/mat-su-school-board-will-choose-some-members-of-challenged-book-committee-instead-of-using-a-lottery/), his seat was moved from the dais to the audience without explanation during the next board meeting in August. The measure to permanently alter the student representative’s involvement was approved the next month.

Most Alaska school boards, including Anchorage’s, allow a student adviser to sit on the dais and ask questions during meetings.

In Mat-Su, the student representative is elected by peers who sit on the district’s student advisory board, which is made up of high school and middle school students who are elected to or apply for the positions. All of the current executive members of that board attend either Wasilla or Career & Tech high schools.

Kolendo said that while Barbara Jackson, his school’s student government adviser, did not tell them to protest or direct students on what to say, she did offer general advice on advocacy best practices, which is part of her role as adviser. That included instruction that students must purchase protest supplies out of pocket, rather than use school supplies, he said.

“All she did during her work day was purely advisory, which is her job as a student government adviser,” Kolendo said.

Ultimately the students did create the signs at the school on a color printer regularly used by students for other noninstructional and politically charged flyers, such as student body Bible clubs or anti-abortion groups, he said.

Jackson said when the students told her they wanted to protest, she was careful to avoid presenting any opinion.

“They clearly had a position — and I did advise them. I did not shy away from that — that’s my job,” she said. “I would describe what I told them as basically Advocacy 101. It would be the same thing I would tell to any group who cared about anything.”

At Wasilla High School, student Schachle said, his peers were primarily worried about possible repercussions for their adviser, Karli Rauchenstein.

Rauchenstein said while she knew no rules had been broken, the questioning felt like a punishment for student political speech that goes against school board opinion.

“I know that I’m doing nothing wrong. I’m willing for anyone to talk to my students, and I’m willing to talk to anyone,” she said. “But the fact that it was done in such a manner feels like it doesn’t matter what my students or I say, that this is a permanent mark on me. And that seems wrong.”",2023-10-17 19:39:14
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",can I assume Hotels in Juneau have WiFi?,"I guess this sounds like a really dumb question but I have a specific reason for asking (which would take a while to explain and is honestly not that interesting). Looking at various hotel websites, they don't mention wifi under the amenities, even though they look like nice modern places, but I'm thinking it's just a given these days.

Or is it possible that they actually don't have WiFi?

Like I said, I have a good reason for asking and worrying about it a little.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",PWS kayaking and camping,"Everyone here was helpful on another one of my threads, so I thought I’d also ask…

I’ll be kayaking PWS for 8 days/nights, about 50 miles. First time to Alaska. First time kayaking where there are whales or camping where there are bears. I’m going with an experienced group and have read a book on the area. 

With all the whale videos where they’re getting a bit aggressive, should I be worried about them tipping my kayak over in PWS? What about using the loo in the woods where there are bears?",2023-06-26 02:05:25

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,relieved","Family member hiking from Bethel, has hypothermia, rescue unavailable due to high winds","Basically title - a cousin of mine (who has lived in Alaska previously several times) was starting a hike from Bethel, Alaska today towards the Yukon River. They are wearing a tracker. They are about thirteen miles out from Bethel, in the swamplands, and developing hypothermia. Per texts from their immediate family, due to the high winds today, rescuers cannot reach them. I am states away and feeling really helpless and powerless. 

No other family members are in Alaska at this time. Does Bethel have any other options for rescue besides air rescue? Will they/can they hike after him or send rescue dogs? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Please be kind, I don’t know much about Alaska. Thank you.  

Edit: Just heard from them directly. They’re hiking back, hypothermia symptoms are mild right now and they know how to handle the symptoms. The way others were wording it, it came across as if they were dying in a ditch somewhere, so I’m relieved to hear the situation is not that serious. Thank you for all the suggestions. 

Edit 2: He’s still wet and cold and exhausted, but does not want to ask for help or press his panic button. He started hiking back but it took him two days to go the 13 miles and now he’s not feeling well so instead he’s hunkered down for the night. I’m worried for him but we’ll see what happens. 

Final Edit: he was rescued & hospitalized but is safe and is going to be okay. Thanks to the people on this post, your suggestions and phone numbers helped us get him help in time. I really appreciate all of the helpful people on here! ",2024-07-26 14:18:52
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,relieved",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky.

First,  thank you to all of you for your suggestions, responses, and offers to  help. Seeing such an outpouring like this has been awesome. Alaskans…  you’ve outdone yourself with generosity and kindness. Thank you. Thank  you. Thank you.

We’ve had over a  dozen folks offer to go and find a matching mug at the various stores in  their area. We’ve had some ( Beercruiser0, goosfrabba, and  throwawayadditionalslice ) that were doing “forensic research” and found  a picture on a Facebook page of a store with the mug in the picture! If  you get a chance - go check out Ben Franklin Store in Juneau. (How they  found THAT mug in the picture…amazing).

Still, others suggest Kintsugi, which was a “down the rabbit hole” research activity for me since I’d never heard of it.

I  even exchanged some notes with the President and CEO of the local  visitor’s bureau. She was very interested in seeing this through  (thanks, lizperry1).

So cool to see online communities and literal communities come together to help like this.

After  posting the situation, we did find the name of the store and contact  information of where we bought the original mug. Through that process,  we contacted Tamala and Alex from Alaska Shirt Company in Juneau  (Another great place to visit and support if you’re in Juneau – they  were Rock Stars). As I’m typing this update, the email just came through  with the tracking number for the order.

So,  in 3-5 business days, with your help and support, I should be able to  hand my wife a replacement mug (hopefully, I won’t drop it when I hand  it to her).  
Thank you all for your help, kind words, and investment  of time to track this down. There can be a lot of meanness and ugliness  in the world. This was not an example of that. You’ve all demonstrated  some of the qualities that represent the very best of us.

Cheers to you all!

My wife and I recently returned from an Alaskan cruise to celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary. During the cruise, we had stops in Juneau, Skagway, and Ketchikan. At one of the stops, my wife found a coffee mug she really liked. I don't remember which store we bought it at, otherwise, I'd contact them directly.

While emptying the dishwasher yesterday, I dropped it. I feel terrible. She says it's not a big deal... It is. I've tried to find it with Google Lens, Amazon, Ebay... no success.

I'm coming to this forum hoping someone can help me out and direct me to where/how I can buy a replacement for her. I've attached images of the (broken) mug for reference. Any help you can offer will be a huge help and greatly appreciated.

IF, by chance, you live in Alaska and can find and purchase this mug, I'd be more than happy (thrilled, really) to work out those details with you to pay you back.

The mug:

* Cream color with a taup(ish), two-tone color along the bottom portion of the mug.
* On the front of the mug, it says ""Alaska -EST. 1959-"" with a tree, bear, and stars in the sky.
* On the inside of the mug, it has a bear claw towards the top rim.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,scared",Classic Question---Denali National Park in May--Gun or no,"I understand just asking the question will get me blown up by some.  Please be kind :).

I've searched/read up on a few posts--some are aged a bit so I thought I'd post with my caveats and get thoughts.  Some background:

Family of 4, all 18+ years old, all in good shape

Will be doing some deep hiking, possible backcountry one night

I am an experienced hunter, including bear (southern, first time in Alaska).  I would not be carrying a light load pistol--I would be carrying my 30/30 Winchester with heavy bear loads.  I carry it on my day pack which has a quick release.  I am very experienced shooting this rifle.  My wife/son would also have bear spray and the 30/30 would be the last resort.  Yes I know that a 45/70 is the guide's preferred lever action, I do not have one and I've read/watched enough I believe my heavy load 30/30 would be good enough.  Again, yes I have experience shooting and levering rounds through this rifle.

&#x200B;

The question is--or perhaps my concern(?)---I do not want to be 'that guy' walking trails with a gun scaring people.  I've talked to a Ranger up there a bit, they seemed 50/50 on guns.  I know the guy I hunted bears in the south with said bear spray is certainly good, provided you can circle in time to get upwind--as strong wind can make it more damaging to you than the bear.  He has experience with this.

So tl/dr, guy wants to make sure he protects his family, has read up on bear behavior, likelihood of attack, will be toting bear spray and only using his rifle as a last resort.  Am I the asshole and will I make people uncomfortable seeing that in Denali?  Only on the deep hikes--if it's a hike with a car drop, 3 mile out/back, not toting obviously.

Thanks for any feedback!",2024-05-07 22:36:18
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,scared",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,scared",Alaska travel during September,"Hello, we are planning to visit Alaska (4 day trip) during the last week of September this year. We thought of it at the last minute. Can you please let me know if it is a bad idea to visit considering the rainy weather and closure of many touristy activities? We are hoping to see the Northern lights but we are travelling to Anchorage. Is it better to travel to Fairbanks instead? ",2023-09-12 20:17:27
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,scared",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,scared",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Haines local life,"The more and more I read about what I consider to be the most beautiful place in the USA (Haines, AK), the more questions I have about what kind of people live there and what local life is really like.

I found a blog called [Motes Mountain Chronicles](https://motesmountain.com) 

They went off grid on Chilkat lake and wrote about it for a few years.

It was the perfect reading for me as I had asked about blogs and vlogs on here a couple days ago and instead of any real answers I was told how stupid I was for even being interested in the area.

I found it odd at all of the backlash I received, but as I read further into this couples’ journey I started to pick up some hints of serious small town drama in their lives.

For instance the whole town was apparently reading their blog and would call the police if they read about something they didn’t like.

It’s interesting to think about someone whom you’ve never met reading something you wrote about a hawk attacking you on your remote property—idk—30 miles from the nearest road? And you clipping its foot in a desperate attempt at survival making it all the way to the feds. 

Anyways, all of a sudden this couples blog just abruptly ends and they put their property up for sale 8 or 9 months after not posting.

I might also add that despite the law issues, they really always spoke highly of the people around them including law enforcement. 95% of what they wrote made it seem like they were enjoying themselves and thriving, no serious red flags outside of near death on the river a few times. But they signed up for that. 

Looking through their comments I see a couple people asked them why they decided to sell and they request people email them directly for that info.

That to me is a huge red flag. 

So then I get to digging around Reddit and this AlaskaHermit person has a huge thread around the corrupt nature of Haines without providing any real specifics. They get drowned out as well.

So this town of Haines seems to have a population of 1600 and you’re telling me hundreds of them are on Reddit? Because why would anyone else care what goes on in a small Alaskan town? 

What does progress in Haines actually look like? I’ve lived in small towns in the lower 48 but the stuff I read about w/haines gives off blockbuster movie cliches. Again… a town of 1600? 😂

I tried to do some geology records on the woman the town was named after and it looks like she had quite a few children. Did the family remain in the borough? Is one of them the sheriff? 

I haven’t read the book If You Lived In This Town I’d Know Your Name yet but it’s on the way. 

All of the drama is pretty exciting for an outsider. But I probably won’t be an outsider for too much longer.",2023-09-28 21:34:02
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Seeking legal help on foreclosure of our off grid cabin in Alaska,"My wife and I had a dream to move to Alaska and live off grid and we finally made our dreams come true in May of 2022. 

When we met an author and her husband we fell in love with their story and their lake cabin in rural Alaska. We made an offer of 250,000 cash and 25,000 financing and they accepted it.

This year we had some life events happen and ended up having to move into town…my wife got pregnant after we were told we could not get pregnant naturally and we didn’t find out until we came into town because she was having terrible stomach pain. We were so excited for our little blessing however we were told we needed to stay in town because she had a placenta tear and if it got any worse they would have to admit her and needed her to come in for weekly visits. 

During that time we fell one payment behind on our mortgage and we were making payments late and paying the late fees as we were getting caught up. When we came into town we only had the clothes on our back, our 3 children (from wife’s previous marriage) and our dog. Finding a job, a place to rent, hitting up every food bank we could, starting from scratch for all household needs, doctors appointments and everything we needed for the kids and new baby became the focus as we navigated our new reality. 

A couple days ago we were mailed a foreclosure letter about our cabin. When we reached out to our mortgage company we found out the sellers did an audit on our account and we were just over $300 behind and our normal payments are about $470. After the audit they closed the account and we had no idea because we made a payment July 21st and no one told us our account was closed and the mortgage company ended up sending us a check back for our about $470 payment. When we reached out to the escrow and foreclosure company they said we have to pay around $6,400 by August 30 to take our cabin out of foreclosure. Unfortunately at this time we do not have that kind of money. 

We are blown away because we have made every payment except for the now two payments of just above $300 and regular payment around $470. We are also being charged with lawyer fees now and fees to bring the property out of foreclosure but that still doesn’t seem to add up to $6400. We are seeking help from lawyers and real estate representatives in our area but really do not want to lose our cabin and investment of 255,000 cash we have already paid the sellers. 
Any help legally or any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!!",2023-08-20 16:57:07

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Working the Summer in Denali. What should I know?,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to respond.

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

 EDIT: Loving all the suggestions guys. Appreciate the welcome",2023-04-02 17:41:40
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited","Sourdough question- how many times was your school canceled due to snow, ice, earthquakes, high winds or volcanos?","I'll go first. Twice. Once for volcano ash fallout and once for extreme high winds that created a negative pressure in the building and sucked the water out of the commodes onto the floor, into the hall and under the front door. 

There was a kid in shop class that had just moved up from texas. He was all excited that snow was predicted that evening. In his mind, school was going to be canceled the next day. ""Be at the bus stop, the bus will show up"". He stayed home. His folks went to work, saw the school buses making their runs, turned around and picked him up and drove him to school.

I’m not sure what to expect with this change of location and lifestyle. We are coming from California. So, we are used to the stereotypical CA weather, going to beach every day, insanely high cost of living/gas/taxes/etc. 

I have gotten feedback from other military families that are/were stationed in Anchorage, but their feedback of course is coming from a military spouse/service member perspective. 

What are some things we should know about prior to arriving? We are extremely excited to embrace the beauty and lifestyle change that is sure to come with moving to Alaska vs California. What are we in for?",2023-07-13 04:46:26

Our family of four (two adults and two teen boys) are so excited to visit Alaska this August. We are taking a cruise from Whittier to Vancouver and we are really interested in exploring the places where the boat stops each day (Skagway, Juneau and Ketchikan.) The cruise offers really expensive excursions at each place but we are more interested in exploring locally in a less fancy fashion. What are some great local things to do and see and local outfits to do it with that aren't too expensive and offer a less mega touristy experience? Anchorage ideas most appreciated too.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",5 Days in Kenai Peninsula ,"Hello all, my girlfriend and I are super excited to be visiting Alaska for the first time in July. We already have our rental car booked. I was looking to get some recommendations for our 5 full days there. We love nature, culture, hiking, music, and food. Taking everyone's advice for our time restrictions, we will only be doing the Kenai Peninsula this time around.

Days 1-3: On our first full day we will be driving down to Seward in the morning from Anchorage. We currently have the first two nights booked in Seward where we are wanting to do a glacier cruise and some kayaking. Any recommendations on companies would be much appreciated. 

Days 3-5: We then spend the next two nights in Homer. Any recommendations on things to do there would be great. However, I'm wondering if 2 nights in Homer is too much... We definitely want to explore the town but I'm thinking maybe doing one night would be enough? I wonder if spending the other night in Soldotna or Coopers Landing would be better, maybe book a rafting trip down the river or spend a half a day fishing for trout or salmon.  What do you all think?

Days 5-6: The last night we'll stay in Anchorage and spend the morning exploring Anchorage before catching our afternoon flight home. 

Let me know what you guys think, definitely open to changes.",2024-05-21 13:51:48

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited","Visiting Alaska (Fairbanks) for the first time Dec 8-11, from SoCal. Advice needed.","Bringing my wife for our anniversary to Fairbanks to show her the northern lights. She has been very excited as this is our first ever trip for anniversary. I want to make sure that I check all the boxes and don't get bogged down by the weather. The weather seems scary (-20 deg C). Not sure what's the best way to prepare without having to spend too much for what's essentially a one time wear. Also, is there a way to know beforehand if we even have a chance of catching the Aurora borealis. The 27 day forecast shows that KP index is at 2 during that time which is like very low solar activity. That means very low aurora visibility. Is my understanding correct?   
Lastly, if we want to drive around, should I rent an AWD SUV or a AWD sedan works fine?   


Thank you very much. 

Edit: thank you all for helping out a novice with such patience. Hopefully, this thread will serve as and advice for people trying to visit Fairbanks in early December.  ",2023-11-28 19:09:05
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Alaska Interior Trip,"Hello all, 

My wife and I are taking an Alaskan cruise and we have decided to book our own interior tour vs. using one through the cruise line. Right now we have 4-5 days to spend and were planning on doing most of this from Anchorage if possible and were looking for thoughts on some of our plans. Right now itinerary would be something along the lines of this. Of note we will be doing this around mid-June 2024

Day 1: Fly into Anchorage, if Denali is worth it would drive into Denali and stay at hotel in Denali that night

Day 2: Denali and drive back to Anchorage that afternoon/evening (understand this will be one of the longest days we have and that's why it's earlier on)

Day 3: Matanuska Glacier and Talkeetna

Day 4: Seward Drive and Town

Day 5: Spend the Day in Anchorage

Day 6: Depart by train for Whittier to leave on ship

Any guidance that could be provided would be extremely helpful.

Thanks very much and so excited for this trip.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Help Deciding Between Boat Tours,"Hello, I'm from the desert and thrilled to be going to Alaska for the first time end of August-beginning of September. The thing I am most excited to see is tide water glaciers. I am planning about a 2 week trip with stops in Juneau, Anchorage/Seward, and Fairbanks. There are lots of day trip by boat tours to see glaciers. Each tour is kind of expensive, but would it be worth it to do 4 different tours? My current ranking from looking at YouTube videos is #1 Tracy Arm Fjords, #2 26 Glaciers, #3 Kenai NP, and #4 Glacier Bay. Would you rank them differently? Are there some I could trim from the list or some that I overlooked and shouldn't miss? Are there any that would be iffy that late in the season?",2024-02-10 20:52:30

We are taking a drive to Seward for 2 days so I am willing to look around that area.

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",How do we pack/dress/travel for December weather in a glass igloo?,"We are traveling to Alaska this Dec for 4 days to stay in the glass igloos and see the aurora! I can’t be more excited! Except for the fact that I was born and raised in the desert and I’m still always cold. I’ve literally never been in more than 4 in of snow and I’ve never been in colder than 20 degree weather. I have NO IDEA how to dress for such cold weather. I’m also unlikely to wear most of it more than 5x over the next 20 years so I don’t want to drop a fortune. But I also don’t want to be cold. Eek! I’ve tried googling but I’m super overwhelmed by options, brands, and opinions. Can you help me simplify this? 

- What do I def need? 
- What is worth investing in versus renting? (For instance they offer overboots to rent. Is that a good option or too cold to wear over some basic winter boots?)

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Is seeing the Northwestern Glacier at Kenai Fjords National Park Worth it?,"Hi Everyone! Excited to be visiting your state next week. As part of our trip, we are staying for a few days in Seward. We are planning to do one of the Major Marine boat tours to really get up close to Kenai Fjords National Park (also we are doing the Harding Ice Trail). I am deciding between the 8.5 Hour Northwestern Glacier Tour and the 7.5 Hour National Park Tour. Is the extra hour and seeing the Northwestern Glacier worth the extra time/money? Or do you think the 7.5 hour National Park tour is just as good. Thank you guys all in advance!",2023-08-16 14:36:27

I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

UPDATE: something’s I have booked can still be canceled or changed for a fee, is it worth rescheduling my flight to 12th through 18th? (Will the weather, and overall opportunities be better?)",2023-09-02 11:57:30
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Moving to Wasilla,"Hi there r/Alaska I hope you are all having a good day. I'm moving to wasilla sometime in June and have a few questions. 

Firstly being is there anything special about the Alaska driving test I will do independent reasearch on there website but I don't want any surprises. 

Second I dont as of yet have a job up there and would like to do something outdoors. To that degree I'm trying to get a hold of matsar to volunteer but that doesn't provide income. I'm not picky though so any websites or jobboards I should check out?

Third where would be a good place to meet people to hike with. Ive been a solo hiker for about 6 years now but being in an area where more large wildlife is present I might want friends just in case.

Any and all information is appreciated I'm excited to join the Alaska family.

We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Getting to Kantishna in 2023,"Hi guys,

I hope this is a good place to ask this question. My friend and I travelling to Anchorage in June to do some hiking in and around Denali. I have found some cool trails near Kantishna that both of us are excited to explore. It seems like normally you would be able to reach the trailheads by bus, however this year the access road is shut as it had been damaged by a landslide. 

Is there a way to get to Kantishna these days?

We were hoping to catch an early morning flight to Kantishna, do our hiking and then leave later in the evening of the same day. I guess this is not possible as all we have been able to find so far is a helicopter taxi from the airport at the entrance to Denali National Park. The helicopter is only available to customers of the lodges near Kantishna and these are completely out of our price range (~$8k for three nights). 

Any ideas how to get to Kantishna for a reasonable price (or any info about that part of the world in general) would be much appreciated!",2023-04-26 12:25:01
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,excited",Travel approx. 8 days with 3 teens.,"Never been to Alaska. We are hoping to come up from OR for about 8-9 days in late August (Yes, I kow it is last minute) with 16 yr old twins who will be great with a scenic trip and a 14 yr old who won't appreciate it as much. I have always wanted to come to Alaska. I grew up on a farm and my husband is a city boy. I want to make it very memorable and have researched it where I am overwhelmed. I am a planner but with all the area and travel time, I am thinking to narrow down the days and enjoy more activities, etc for my kids. Basically, most itineraries I see about roughly are 2 days in Anchorage, then Talkeetna then Denali a few days and to Palmer and Seward. There are variations of course. I want it to be relaxing and I am fine driving alot but my kids, maybe not so much. We want to see some sites, relax, eat and hit a few museums. I realize this will be just a starter trip and can always come back but I thought I would ask locals. We are semi-active but not hikers by any means. I am thinking fewer towns, maybe a day cruise or something special/exciting for the kids but husband and daughter get sea sick hence did not even consider a cruise which I am not really into anyhow. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I know you get a lot of questions like this but really, I will be grateful for the help. ",2023-07-14 03:29:45

Since all posts on this topic invariably lead to the same replies, I'll kick it off:

First poster while whine about the article being behind a paywall instead of free like all things in Alaska are supposed to be.

Second poster will advocate an income tax. Someone will reply about how they moved to Alaska specifically to avoid paying income taxes in whatever state they came from, and how half the state earns no income and they'll be damned if only half the state should chip in.

Third poster will stan for a sales tax and the replies will be all about how regressive that is for low income Alaskans, and they'll be damned if the state is going to further add to exorbitant prices out in the bush.

Fourth will be about how we need to cut the budget to 1997 levels since nothing should have increased in price since then.

Number five will invoke the sacred mantle of Jay Hammond to confidently assert that paying PFD checks is the only essential function of state government, because some mumbo jumbo about how Alaskans are owed money forever from the government they voted for because it stole their rights to non-existent minerals on land they do not own.

Reply number six will propose some bizarre alcoholic type bargain where we end the PFD, but only after ""one last payout"" of some absurd amount like $60k.

Number 7 will be some thinly disguised racist rant about how ""these people move here just for the PFD,"" when in reality no one moves here just for the PFD.

Anyone got anything new?

My solution (lest I be accused of offering none) is very simple: end the PFD and use the fund as the rain day solution to pay for public services it was always intended as, and end per-barrel production credits.

The rest of the replies will be histrionics about how ending the PFD handouts is taking food from babies mouths, is stealing, is taxes, is regressive when it is none of those things, just an end to free handouts of money you didn't earn and don't deserve.

This sick dependency culture is the worst thing about Alaska and is going to permanently ruin our fiscal future.",2023-07-13 23:40:11
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,Ruined",Alaskan Story Time!  Did you do something in the past you feel 'ok' to talk about now?,"I will start.

1989? Kodiak Island. Wife and I are hunting out on Narrow Cape and Kelsin Bay. She gets a nice doe. Its in the bed of our black and silver Jeep Comanche pickup that has a white topper.  On the way home we swing down the road to Saltery Cove to see if I can find a deer.  We are a few hundred yards from the truck..... and both get the feeling we are being watched.  It's spooky. We go back to the truck.... she spotted a little blood dripping from the bed. As we leave the place where we parked another truck arrives - same size as ours, and also black and silver with a white top and parks where we did.  Two days later on the front page of the Kodiak Daily Mirror is a picture of that truck, the owner, and Mr. Sweeny from Sweeny Insurance Agency.  Seems the owner walked off to do some fishing and when he came back - his truck was totally beat to shit by a bear!  It had scraped the paint job all over, ripped off trim, the topper was ruined - big chew marks in it........ and the owner was at a total loss of words.  I remember the paper quoted him as saying, ""There was nothing in the truck. Not even a sandwich. I have no idea why a bear would do this.""  And then quote from his insurance agent, ""I've never had to process a claim like this in my whole career.""

If you see this Mr. Sweeny or the owner - sorry - our bad. ",2024-08-03 19:00:50
Alaska,BOTH,"Rainy day,Ruined",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Alaska,BOTH,"Sunny,hate","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Sunny,like","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Sunny,like","""I saw houses being washed away in Alaska. Stop the victim blaming""","It was a hot, sunny day in Alaska's capital city, uncharacteristic of the largest temperate rainforest in the world. My nineteen-year-old niece and I were chatting about global warming, as Alaskans do whenever we get too hot.

“Global warming?” my niece laughed. “More like global *burning*.”

Hours later, ice melt that had accumulated in a Mendenhall Glacier basin over the last year crested the glacial dam.

Alaska,BOTH,"Sunny,like",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

Alaska,BOTH,"Sunny,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Freedom of continuing in existence,
Appreciating life as it is bliss.
Blessed were my eyes with your rapids,
New lands,
Filled with rivers and salmon in abundance.

There could be many adventures, but you,
You came to me with a calling,
Yes, you, who have given me hope,
With your towering mountains and evergreen forests,
Your glacial ice that glistens like diamonds.

Take the clouds, bring the snow, 
Run the rivers, and take my soul, 
Throw your breeze in my direction, 
May it be cold or hot, 
Be it sunny or night, I will be yours.

Oh, land of mysteries and untamed beauty,
Take my soul and be my nurture,
Give me your peaceful land with no fear,
Where eagles soar and bears roam,
Give me the freedom to explore you,
Oh, Last Frontier.",2023-07-06 14:40:33

Alaska,BOTH,"Snowstorm,enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
Alaska,BOTH,"Blizzard,love",Alaska becoming bad for families?,"I love this state. Ive lived here all my life and want my children to grow up here but I don’t know if I can do it anymore. I’ve had to take 6 (SIX!) vacation days because schools were closed. The superintendent insists that it is because the streets are unplowed and I believe him. I’ve never seen our main roads this bad, let alone our neighborhood roads. And none of the closures have been blizzards or emergencies, just normal snowfall!

In the summer, I want to take my kids on the same trails I played on with my friends as a kid. But they are filled with homeless people, some of whom have assaulted and SA’d minors. Even supervised, it doesn’t seem like a safe place for kids.

My wife and I are debating moving somewhere where the government can keep the city and state running and safe. It breaks my heart that nobody seems to care about keeping this state functioning. Especially with all the “best place for families” talk that is clearly just lip service.",2023-12-13 19:31:14

Alaska,BOTH,"Hurricane,love",How did Joe Biden use HAARP to create Hurricane Milton?,"Posting this here because I left a message on Nick Begich's answering machine and still haven't heard back.

Deputy party leader Marjorie Taylor Green recently confirmed on X (love you Elon!) what we all had suspected: Hurricane Milton was created by Democrats using advanced military technology to steal the election. As Alaskans, we know this means HAARP, just as we know the Republican party to be an irrefutable source of truth which should never be questioned.

But it still left me wondering how exactly do they create the hurricane using HAARP? According to wikipedia, HAARP is run by a well-known CIA/DoD front organization, the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It uses high frequency transmitters to excite the atmosphere. But my question is, how does exciting the atmosphere above Fairbanks cause a hurricane all the way down in Florida? And how do they make it so it only targets Republicans?

Does anyone like maybe a physicist or someone who was employed at UAF know how this whole thing works? I tried to do my own research by ordering Begich Sr.'s book from Nick's web site, but they said it was out of print (almost certainly due to CIA interference). Also, does anyone know if this could be connected to the wind storm that ripped the roof off my house a few winters back? Cause my insurance guy will want to know.",2024-10-10 02:12:19

Alaska,BOTH,"Windy,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,like",Ideas for care packages for homeless (Anchorage) ,"I know the homeless are bothersome for most but I would like to help them this year. They don’t deserve to freeze to death. I see a lot of individuals in sleeping bags or even on the ground. If they miss curfew or the shelter is full, they really have no where to go and struggle to stay warm. Some do have jobs but cannot get housing. 

I am wondering if there is a laundromat that does tokens or gift vouchers in Anchorage, that is somewhat centrally located. I would like to give them a “load of clean laundry”.

I have the following on my list: 

Hats 
Gloves 
Socks
Beanies 
Hot hands warmer
Hot feet warmers
Foil blankets 
Feminine hygiene products 
Condoms 
Shower wipes 
Flushable wipes 
Tide pods
Cup of Noodles (microwaveable) 

Anything I should add ? 

Edit: I added toothpaste, toothbrush, first aid kits, deodorant to my Amazon cart. I am thinking I will buy small bottles or containers and filling them with shampoo/conditioner/body wash 

I don’t plan on going into “homeless” camps. I have “regulars” I see on my patrols that sleep in doorways and cars. These are the people I’d like to help immediately. I feel terrible asking individuals to leave back into the cold. 

I think a cup of soup would be nice. I could carry a thermos of hot water to make it on the spot. Hand warmers and feet warmers would probably make a good gift as well. ",2024-11-10 07:50:17
Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,like",How to walk in Anchorage without freezing to death? No car.,"Hello this december I will be in Anchorage for this winter. 

I am wondering how tu survive without car. My friends can give me a ride to go groceries or some important places. But I don't want to abuse. However they are very nice and kind. 

Be a pedestrian in Anchorage was all an adventure this summer and I imagine that this winter will be a horror with inches and inches of snow. I am afraid I don't want to freezing to death waiting People Mover (Bus) or walking for example 15 or 30 minutes. Or fall on the slippery floor.

I was two times in Alaska. This summer and last march.  I am from European Union. We went to walk all places and the distances are more short. 

People recommended don't bring snow clothes from my country and get in Alaska. I will take the minimous to be warm. T-shirts and thermal pants. And I will dress in layers like an onion.

I hope that somebody can help me with his/her wise.

Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,like",Cold weather photographers? (a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,like",Is it possible that bison could form a small population in the Northern Slope?,"I'm serious because it recently occurred to me what specifically speaks against it, not from ecological points, but from purely biological ones.

The bison has a very thick fur, and in Wyoming or Montana they can sometimes get frost down to -45°C or so and it freezes there for 3 months +. In order for it to survive, it uses its head, which has an extremely muscular neck, to dig under the snow for blades of grass/straw that have overwintered.

The bison is an inhabitant of the prairies, i.e. open grasslands with small grasses, medium-sized grasses or large grasses. Then I saw pictures of the northern slope and, probably thanks to climate change, saw very tall, unmown grass, which would be ideal for feeding bison.

Hence the following thought experiment:

200 bison would be released into the wild in the North Slope and the bison would not be allowed to be shot by the natives. What would the population look like in 30 years, what would happen to the landscape and if the population died, why? The calculation also includes the fact that the frost-free period is extended by several hours or days every year, thanks to climate change.

How would you assess this? Would you think it's a good idea? If not, why not?

And I'm serious here! And since the question is **about Alaska** and I see your wildlife photos all the time, so you know about animals and your country, I think this question belongs here too.",2024-05-27 18:58:14
Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,like",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37
Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,like",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

I was wondering which battery maintainer y’all used since it has to be able to perform well in -50°, and I was curious about which ones y’all trust. And do any of y’all mount the maintainer itself to some sort of heat source like a battery blanket? That way it would prevent the maintainer from freezing.

Alaska,BOTH,"Freezing,annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm. We do need to be budget conscious, he's on scholarship we aren't ""just"" putting him on a plane to Alaska for a week lol, but I'm also not worried about whether we'll ever use the gear again, my 12 yo goes camping with scouts frequently so things will get used.

I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Help me find this newlywed couple!!,"Hey! I was at Lowell point in seward this Saturday and I happened to snap a pic of this newlywed couple before they hopped in a heli and took off. I'm just an amateur photographer, but I really love this snapshot. They were there with three other people (looked like parents) plus the pilot, and I'm hoping to get this to them. If the internet could help me find these people... I wish y'all a long, happy, and healthy relationship! Congrats! ",2024-07-22 01:10:00
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love","Hiking South Fork Valley, Chugach Mountains in Alaska today.","We were on a quest to pick blueberries, but got thwarted by a cold, steady rain. It was a lovely, serene hike, about 3 miles total. ",2024-08-30 00:46:43
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love","Thinking of moving, need ideas","30f. The long, cold, dark winters seem to be getting worse and I need new scenery (physically and mentally) to grow as a person and gain more experience. 

I love the small town feel of the valley while still having access to decent amenities. 

I can’t do big cities and spend an hour in traffic every day. 

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons. 

But not regular temperatures over 90. 

I appreciate all ideas!",2024-08-19 00:36:39

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Am I Crazy?,"Hello, y'all! I'm a Texan hoping to vacation up in Alaska at some point next year in 2025, when money hopefully won't be quite as tight, been saving up a while. It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway). Here's where things get a little funky, though not at all serious

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit! But what do I know, I'm not Alaskan. On the other hand, y'all are, so what do y'all think? Am I really crazy? Hope y'all had a great new year up there!",2024-01-02 05:45:35
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Where to move?,"My wife and I are considering moving to Alaska, and I’d rather ask people who live there then wade through “top 10” google searches. I worked in Alaska a number of years ago in soldotna, we are both Eastern WA natives, so cold and winter are normal for us and we are making a list of towns to check out. We are in our early 30’s with one child, we are moderate/libertarian politically, looking for a community but also large enough we would still have some stuff to do. Preferably coastal, would love to own a few acres out side town if possible. Professionally my wife has a criminal justice psychology degree but has worked in an receptionist/insurance for years. I’m a diesel mechanic but have a side business in videography. We are aware of the winter darkness, midnight sun and possibility of owning boat rather than a car lol we are reaching a point we would like to unplug from the rat race and be a little more Simple and self sufficient. Sorry for the wordy post, thanks for any advice. Also please no anchorage lol",2023-09-07 06:21:01
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Interested in Moving,"Hi!!! I’m interested in moving to Alaska. Let me tell you about myself so you can give me some recommendations. I HATE the cold, it makes me feel so sad and shivery. I also don’t like snow, however I can tolerate it when it is still in the liquid form. All that aside, let me tell you about my favorite hobbies!! I hate skiing, sledding, snowboarding, fishing, Ice fishing, hiking, driving in any condition other than plain concrete, and bending over too much. It hurts my wee little back. On the contrary, I love tanning, surfing, scuba diving, dancing, and parasailing. Let me talk about my fears. Bears are so scary!!!

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Moving to Anchorage?,"Hello everyone! I have a quick question for all of you. I'm considering moving to Anchorage for my job. I'm originally from Central IL, but I've been living in Oklahoma City for the last few months. I love the cold and the outdoors. I really think I would enjoy living in Alaska during the spring, summer, and fall. I'm slightly concerned about living there in the winter due to the snow and ice.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Tips for Food and Clothing for First-Timers?,"**EDIT**:  Disregard!  I didn't see that r/AlaskaTravel existed when I searched Reddit.

Greetings!

My apologies if this isn't the right place or way of inquiring.

My wife and I will be visiting Alaska sometime in August of this year with another couple, and we'll be staying in Seward, Anchorage, Homer, and perhaps one other city.

None of us have ever been, and are just starting to do research.  My wife and I are responsible for coming up with multiple restaurant options for the cities where we'll be staying.  I found a travel blog from a former native that seemed pretty good for the cities I listed above, but I was wondering if anyone had suggestions of their own.

We have no food allergies, are open to anything, and we plan to avoid the usual tourist traps where possible.  The four of us prefer to immerse ourselves in the culture wherever we go, but at the same time, we have no interest in rubbing shoulders where we wouldn't at least be tolerated.  Specifically, we would NOT be looking to force ""a connection"" with the locals.  We want to enjoy the food, the scenery, and the grandeur while always being respectful of everyone just living their daily lives.

My wife and I would also love some suggestions on clothing.  We'll be taking a ship to see glaciers and also doing a panning for gold thing, so our tenderfoot asses are definitely going to be spending a lot of time outdoors.  I've been on the East Coast in December, but I'm sure that's just a fraction of the kind of cold we might encounter.

We have an REI in our town, but we'd prefer to get recommendations from those who've tested their gear on a daily basis instead of relying on someone who's never been ""on the ground"" and just wants to move product that they've never worn themselves.

Thanks very much!",2024-03-04 20:29:14

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Where to go next,"I spent the summer with a family member in Anchorage and had the opportunity to visit a lot of places in that area as well as Homer and Seward and even up to Denali for a weekend of backcountry camping in unit 10. Loved all of it, especially the friendly people.

I am hoping to come up again before the main tourist season begins but am not sure where to go this time. Of course I love camping but I think it's probably still too cold for that so I am content with just walking around and taking some photos. I thought about flying up to Ketchikan from Seattle and heading over to Sitka but it seems those towns are big for cruises and the last thing I want is being around mobs of cruisers. Are these two towns easily walkable without needing a car?

Nome seems like an interesting city. Would that be worth visiting for a few days?

Edit: forgot to mention that at least in my town, outsiders are truly hated sometimes and when people move there it's actually horrifying seeing how they are treated. It's like the locals want to drive everyone out of town. It took my mom a year to even make friends there when she moved because so many people were trashing her saying there was no way she'd make it and that she would leave soon, then she ended up staying and became good friends with everyone.

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,hate",Overcoming Nostalgia ,"My family and I moved away from AK over 7 years ago when I was just 11 years old... but as each year passes and the more l've grown up and come of age living in California, the harder and more homesick I get for Alaska. It's become so bad to the point where not a day goes by when I don't start reminiscing and thinking back to growing up in such a beautiful place.
For context, I was born in Fairbanks and my family and I moved a lot across AK, mainly in small villages (only accessible by bush plane) across Central and Northern Alaska. It was so hard for us to live, but now when I look back I only see the positives.

I know it's not the most ideal state for living, and I remember when I was actually growing up there I really hated it. I hated living in Alaska as a kid because it felt so isolating and lonely and obviously very cold, and it was difficult for my parents to provide for my siblings and I and I could see the toll it took on them to work and live in quite literally the middle of nowhere.

I think I've just grown bitter about living in the Bay Area and am sick of the cost of living and sheer volume of people that live here, and l've also grown fearful that living in the Bay has made me lose my identity as an Alaskan and lose a lot of the qualities I like to think Alaskans have like resilience and grit and toughness. Or maybe I just miss being a kid, like most people. My family and l often discuss wanting to go back to Anchorage or Fairbanks just for a visit, but it's never come to fruition because of how
expensive a trip would be. I honestly don't want to go back to living in Alaska, but it's been over 7 years since l've left and I just want to return back to the place where I was born and raised even just for a little bit. Sorry for the venting, I just wasn't sure where else to put this.",2024-10-04 06:11:45
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,hate",Advice for moving to and finding work in Alaska?,"I am in the early stages of looking into what it would take to move to and find work in Alaska, as I grew up in colder climates (not Alaska cold) and really hate being hot all the time.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

All that aside, let me tell you about my favorite hobbies!! I hate skiing, sledding, snowboarding, fishing, Ice fishing, hiking, driving in any condition other than plain concrete, and bending over too much. It hurts my wee little back. On the contrary, I love tanning, surfing, scuba diving, dancing, and parasailing. Let me talk about my fears. Bears are so scary!!! Luckily there are none here right! 😁 Mosquitos scare me too, and so does the dark. Me and my family were looking at Utqiagvik, as i’m sure it has all my likings. What do you think?

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,enjoy",Looking for five star or enjoyable restaurants in Alaska,"My main place I would like to go is Anchorage. I plan on taking the shuttle from Anchorage to Fairbanks and onwards to Seward. I am planning on going to AK from Los Angeles, CA in June of this year. That way it won't be crazy cold. I have googled some restaurants but the reviews are mixed so I am relying on you guys to tell me what places are really good. Main interest is salmon and crab legs. It doesn't have to be these two for my experience to be enjoyable.",2024-04-12 17:31:02
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,enjoy",Am I Crazy?,"Hello, y'all! I'm a Texan hoping to vacation up in Alaska at some point next year in 2025, when money hopefully won't be quite as tight, been saving up a while. It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway). Here's where things get a little funky, though not at all serious

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit! But what do I know, I'm not Alaskan. On the other hand, y'all are, so what do y'all think? Am I really crazy? Hope y'all had a great new year up there!",2024-01-02 05:45:35
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Greetings!

My apologies if this isn't the right place or way of inquiring.

My wife and I will be visiting Alaska sometime in August of this year with another couple, and we'll be staying in Seward, Anchorage, Homer, and perhaps one other city.

None of us have ever been, and are just starting to do research.  My wife and I are responsible for coming up with multiple restaurant options for the cities where we'll be staying.  I found a travel blog from a former native that seemed pretty good for the cities I listed above, but I was wondering if anyone had suggestions of their own.

We have no food allergies, are open to anything, and we plan to avoid the usual tourist traps where possible.  The four of us prefer to immerse ourselves in the culture wherever we go, but at the same time, we have no interest in rubbing shoulders where we wouldn't at least be tolerated.  Specifically, we would NOT be looking to force ""a connection"" with the locals.  We want to enjoy the food, the scenery, and the grandeur while always being respectful of everyone just living their daily lives.

My wife and I would also love some suggestions on clothing.  We'll be taking a ship to see glaciers and also doing a panning for gold thing, so our tenderfoot asses are definitely going to be spending a lot of time outdoors.  I've been on the East Coast in December, but I'm sure that's just a fraction of the kind of cold we might encounter.

We have an REI in our town, but we'd prefer to get recommendations from those who've tested their gear on a daily basis instead of relying on someone who's never been ""on the ground"" and just wants to move product that they've never worn themselves.

Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Sorry but as someone who grew up in Alaska...,"It makes me feel so validated when I see people responding to the ""should I move here"" posts by saying absolutely not, it's depressing, dark and cold, get out while you can. Having spend 19 years there (against my will), agreed.

People are always asking me what it was like living in Alaska and I have a generic response about the beautiful nature and small island I'm from, but really it is ROUGH especially if you're not the exact type of person who wants to live there.

Edit: forgot to mention that at least in my town, outsiders are truly hated sometimes and when people move there it's actually horrifying seeing how they are treated. It's like the locals want to drive everyone out of town. It took my mom a year to even make friends there when she moved because so many people were trashing her saying there was no way she'd make it and that she would leave soon, then she ended up staying and became good friends with everyone. She tells that story like it's nice but it actually shows how unwelcoming it is. Maybe it's just my town that's that way, but jfc I could go onnn.",2023-11-02 21:26:08
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",I’m homeless and losing hope ,"I recently moved from wasilla to anchorage after falling on hard times and becoming homeless about 2 months ago. My girlfriend and I are both living in my tiny ford focus and it’s been rough.

I’ve had a hard past and had made some mistakes but am now on the straight and narrow. Neither of us use drugs and we both got full time jobs less than a week after moving here. We work retail and have managed to save around $2000 and are currently looking for housing. I’m contemplating staying at a shitty motel since I’ve been wasting money on application fees on apartments. I’ve applied for 5 now and have been turned down each time due to my record. No felonies but theres been some mistakes.

Ive changed since then and learned from my mistakes. I’m a good person, I try to do good and help those around me and stay far away from trouble now. I have no family or friends out here and I’m starting to lose hope. Maybe I’m just destined to live like this forever and it won’t get better.  I feel like anybody should get a second chance and I feel like I’ve been making all the right and healthy decisions lately but it’s hard to stay positive.

I just reaching out in case anyone knows of any housing or any communities that could help us. We have food stamps and our work is letting us stay in the parking lot to sleep. We use the food pantry to get food every now and then. I just want a roof over my head before it gets too cold. I’m tired of feeling judged and looked down upon or like I’m a drug addict because I’ve fallen on hard times. Being homeless is not easy. Constantly trying to find time to shower and what to eat, or where to sleep, wondering if I’ll ever be able to find housing, staying warm. Our eating habits are terrible right now. No hot food except fast food and it’s destroying my stomach. And working 40+ hours a week at a shitty retail store on top of that with no bed to come home to.

I hope all of my hard work pays off soon because I’m starting to lose hope. If anyone could help or give me any advice I’d be grateful. Peace ✌️",2024-09-08 06:52:12

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Ideas for care packages for homeless (Anchorage) ,"I know the homeless are bothersome for most but I would like to help them this year. They don’t deserve to freeze to death. I see a lot of individuals in sleeping bags or even on the ground. If they miss curfew or the shelter is full, they really have no where to go and struggle to stay warm. Some do have jobs but cannot get housing. 

I am wondering if there is a laundromat that does tokens or gift vouchers in Anchorage, that is somewhat centrally located. I would like to give them a “load of clean laundry”.

I have the following on my list: 

Hats 
Gloves 
Socks
Beanies 
Hot hands warmer
Hot feet warmers
Foil blankets 
Feminine hygiene products 
Condoms 
Shower wipes 
Flushable wipes 
Tide pods
Cup of Noodles (microwaveable) 

Anything I should add ? 

Edit: I added toothpaste, toothbrush, first aid kits, deodorant to my Amazon cart. I am thinking I will buy small bottles or containers and filling them with shampoo/conditioner/body wash 

I don’t plan on going into “homeless” camps. I have “regulars” I see on my patrols that sleep in doorways and cars. These are the people I’d like to help immediately. I feel terrible asking individuals to leave back into the cold. 

I think a cup of soup would be nice. I could carry a thermos of hot water to make it on the spot. Hand warmers and feet warmers would probably make a good gift as well. ",2024-11-10 07:50:17

I'm looking at two pieces right now, they have different down to waterfowl feathers ratios, for one is pretty much all down, and one is half and half. I have no clue what this means, or if it's that big of a difference to my old coat. 

If anyone could let me know anything about coats I'd really appreciate it! A bit scared for the winter, and I run cold. I already got rabbit fur Italian leather gloves (I don't like wool touching my hands) and thick alpaca socks.",2024-10-01 03:55:00

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Looking to move to an Inuit community in Alaska,"Hello, I am considering moving to Alaska for work for a year or two. I usually like to visit places before moving there to see if I like it but I currently live outside of North America about a 25 hour flight away even from Anchorage so it's a bit unfeasible and too expensive to do so and I don't have the leave to take off work for it.  Therefore, I was hoping you guys might have some advice for me instead. 

I am Inuit so would like somewhere that has a sizeable Inuit community (or at least of another closely related eskimo people like Yupik, Aleut, Inupiat, Sugpiaq, or Alutiiq). Even better if there are still speakers of their native language. The town I grew up in had around 6000 people so I don't mind the size so much although preferably somewhere not too small or that is at least close to a larger settlement for the infrastructure and buying things. If it's somewhere that's still within an hour or so from a major town/city then that would be perfect. What is the crime like in Alaska?

I really like hiking so somewhere with beautiful scenery that is accessible for that would be nice. I do spearfishing as well although I'm guessing it's too cold for that in Alaska? Is hunting available pretty much everywhere or only some regions?

Also, sorry to ask and no offense meant, but I have heard people say that Alaska is kinda racist towards indigenous people. The people I've met from Alaska have all been very likeable though so I was wondering is that true or just a myth? I have an Inuit first name so will I be fine using it on job applications or should I put an English nickname instead?

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like","The Depicting Alaska in TV Shows, Movies and Video Games Checklist for Dummies","With the first trailer for the 4th season of True Detective having dropped recently, I've been thinking about how every single TV show, movie or video game set in Alaska all feature the same exact stuff to really beat the viewer/player over the head with the fact that ""This is Alaska and Alaska is different!""

So, in no particular order:

* A scene with a moose where the main character acts like it's the most majestic animal they've ever seen.  Why do these things never depict them as the tank-sized garden terrorists that they are?
* Wolves and bears are treated like they're the greatest threat to human survival since sliced bread.
* Bonus: That one scene where you can hear wolves howling in the background and someone makes a remark about how it's not safe to linger.
* Someone will point out multiple times per episode that it's like -40, just to drive the point across that it's really cold.
* Bonus: It's set in winter because Alaska never experiences summer, spring or fall.
* Every character likes hockey.
* There are no cities in Alaska, only endless forests, tundra or mountains.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",How cold does Alaska feel?,"I'm from Illinois and went to Colorado, and in the mountains, it was 17 degrees but felt so different than 17 degrees back in Illinois. Is Alaska like this where the cold doesn't feel as cold?",2024-05-19 22:12:34
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Cold weather photographers? (a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Vanning it for College in Anchorage,"I'm hoping to be attending University of Alaska Anchorage starting next fall. I've been living out of a van for 4 years (including wintering through at ski resorts in Washington). So I'm comfortable in the cold with my setup, having experienced the struggle of -20 degree nights, and cold days with little to no sun. The intention however, is to do long-term stays Fall-Spring at RV parks (I've found 3 already, right near the University that would be open for that kind of stay).   


I suppose my questions are these: during winter, how are the roads within Anchorage? I assume that like mountain towns in WA, they'd have pretty good road clearing systems. Are power outages common? This could come as a heavy hit if it's longer than a few days in a van that's generally staying hooked up all the time. What types of communal areas are generally available during the winter? Are places like coffee shops and libraries where you can hang out and study without being on campus fairly common? And any other comments you might have that may be helpful. Just for clarification purposes though, bear in mind - I am comfortably familiar with living out of a van in harsh winter conditions. Looking at record highs and lows, and average highs and lows and snow fall amounts - what's up there seems to be pretty well within the same parameters I usually operate in during the winter when living at ski resorts for the winter in the van.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Overcoming Nostalgia ,"My family and I moved away from AK over 7 years ago when I was just 11 years old... but as each year passes and the more l've grown up and come of age living in California, the harder and more homesick I get for Alaska. It's become so bad to the point where not a day goes by when I don't start reminiscing and thinking back to growing up in such a beautiful place.
For context, I was born in Fairbanks and my family and I moved a lot across AK, mainly in small villages (only accessible by bush plane) across Central and Northern Alaska. It was so hard for us to live, but now when I look back I only see the positives.

I know it's not the most ideal state for living, and I remember when I was actually growing up there I really hated it. I hated living in Alaska as a kid because it felt so isolating and lonely and obviously very cold, and it was difficult for my parents to provide for my siblings and I and I could see the toll it took on them to work and live in quite literally the middle of nowhere.

I think I've just grown bitter about living in the Bay Area and am sick of the cost of living and sheer volume of people that live here, and l've also grown fearful that living in the Bay has made me lose my identity as an Alaskan and lose a lot of the qualities I like to think Alaskans have like resilience and grit and toughness. Or maybe I just miss being a kid, like most people. My family and l often discuss wanting to go back to Anchorage or Fairbanks just for a visit, but it's never come to fruition because of how
expensive a trip would be. I honestly don't want to go back to living in Alaska, but it's been over 7 years since l've left and I just want to return back to the place where I was born and raised even just for a little bit. Sorry for the venting, I just wasn't sure where else to put this.",2024-10-04 06:11:45

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",I wrote a buyers guide to cold climate heat pumps,"Hi - The New England Subreddits really liked this, and asked me to share here, so: I've just installed my own heat pump and hit 100% fossil fuel free (really!).

Along the way, I found quotes were difficult to understand and sometimes misleading. So, I wrote the guide I wish I'd had to help homeowners be informed customers. I focus on questions like: ""will it heat my house in the cold?"", ""Which of this feature-based marketing actually matters?"", and ""Why the heck do we measure performance by the ton?"" ...Without getting in to the technicalities of thermodynamic cycles.

Hope you find this useful, and feedback is welcome.

I love the small town feel of the valley while still having access to decent amenities. 

I can’t do big cities and spend an hour in traffic every day. 

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons. 

But not regular temperatures over 90.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Am I Crazy?,"Hello, y'all! I'm a Texan hoping to vacation up in Alaska at some point next year in 2025, when money hopefully won't be quite as tight, been saving up a while. It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway). Here's where things get a little funky, though not at all serious

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit! But what do I know, I'm not Alaskan. On the other hand, y'all are, so what do y'all think? Am I really crazy? Hope y'all had a great new year up there!",2024-01-02 05:45:35
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like","Looking for testimonies for my bachelor thesis : negative emotions (discomfort, wanting to quit) on long cold tours in the nature","Hey!

I am starting a bachelor thesis for my ""Nature guiding and arctic outdoor life"" degree.  
I would like to write it about the physical discomfort and the negative emotions during long ski tours. I think maybe writing in the Alaska reddit would put me in touche with some who like arctic adventure :)   
  
I have not decided of my research question yet, but here are some questions I am interested in:

* **evolution** of the negative feelings: does it get better or worse, and why?
* **nature** of the negative feelings: temperature, anxiety, unknown, equipment fail, loneliness, boredom, phyiscal pain, bad smell, being dirty, being sweaty....
* **coping mechanism**: state of mind, actual improvement, ignoring your needs...

I am trying to collect testimonies and information to have an idea of what could be an interresting focus. My focus is long solo ski tours in cold climate (under -10 degrees), but I can for sure find interesting information in long tours with more than 1 person, and with another means of transportation - snow shoes, dogs... in remote nature.

Thank you for your help!",2024-09-20 11:42:20
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Where to move?,"My wife and I are considering moving to Alaska, and I’d rather ask people who live there then wade through “top 10” google searches. I worked in Alaska a number of years ago in soldotna, we are both Eastern WA natives, so cold and winter are normal for us and we are making a list of towns to check out. We are in our early 30’s with one child, we are moderate/libertarian politically, looking for a community but also large enough we would still have some stuff to do. Preferably coastal, would love to own a few acres out side town if possible. Professionally my wife has a criminal justice psychology degree but has worked in an receptionist/insurance for years. I’m a diesel mechanic but have a side business in videography. We are aware of the winter darkness, midnight sun and possibility of owning boat rather than a car lol we are reaching a point we would like to unplug from the rat race and be a little more Simple and self sufficient. Sorry for the wordy post, thanks for any advice. Also please no anchorage lol",2023-09-07 06:21:01
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?  Specifically Anchorage, but maybe Fairbanks, which I gather means a few tens of degrees colder...

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Thanks in advance, I look forward to hearing y'all's suggestions!",2024-01-10 23:10:52
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Travel Nurse Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I am a nurse who is looking to pick up some travel contracts. The ones I have been looking at the most (I.e. the ones that pay the most) have been listings in Alaska, specifically Juneau and Anchorage. I’ve been looking to leave my current job for a while, and would like to start this contract as soon as I hit my two year mark with them in mid January. However, I also know how intense winter is over there so I’m hoping to get some advice on when would be the best time to go/how bad of an idea it would be to start my contract sometime in mid/late February.

Some context: I am from New England so I’m no stranger to cold weather in the winter and the contracts I’m looking at would provide me with housing so i wouldn’t have to worry about that. I was also planning on leasing a car once I get there.

Thanks so much!",2023-11-19 15:01:44
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Thank you!",2023-12-05 01:47:15
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Seriously considering a move to good ole Alaska,"I am sure this is a crazy common post, but here is yet another. Delete if not allowed (: 

My husband and I (both 26) are looking to move to Alaska. I’ve always wanted to go, and he is up for the adventure. We both prefer cold and aren’t really a fan of having super closer neighbors (we can currently see into our neighbors house. It sucks). 

I am a software developer, and he is in school to be a teacher. We are both veterans with clearances. 

We have 7 pets (4 dogs 3 cats), looking for a house to grow a family in (so like a 3 bed at least) and acreage to let our dogs stretch their legs (up to 5, don’t need a lot). We were looking at Fairbanks or Juneau. I know they’re pretty far apart, but just to give y’all something to work off of. 

So, with the formalities out of the way, what do you think we could expect in finding jobs, a house, life and community? Pros and cons? What to do to prepare? We will probably drive and will probably look into getting a new vehicle as well. I want a 4Runner, he wants a truck. We will be able to live off of one car for awhile. Which would be better? If neither, what should we get? 

Give me the nitty gritty and the best! Thanks (:",2023-08-14 02:30:55

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Fairbanks College Student with Heart disease and no health insurance.,"Hello, thank you for your consideration.

I'm a university student and I have 2 students jobs at the university. But I recently was told by my on-campus doctor I have extremely high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, she was very concerned. 

I'm in shape physically, I eat healthy and don't have a lot of bodyfat, so there's not much lifestyle changes I can make, except more sleep.

Unfortunately, I'm in Interior Alaska and I have no healthcare. I applied for medicaid and so I may have it at some point? 

There's very few cardiologists here and only one accepts medicaid and they said I have to wait until May to get seen. If I do have state medicaid, I can only be seen in state, so I guess Anchorage would be my only other major option.

I'm getting more exhausted everyday and the doctor said no exercise, stay in phone service range because I might have to make a 911 call at any moment. So it's hard to sleep, in case I need to call 911. It's hard to focus at school, Im not panicking, I'm being pretty calm all things considered. But my life and memories are popping into my head and all I can think about is everyday, I smell blood, have worse vision, feel cold flowing across my chest and my heart feels like its working harder and harder. 

I just wish I spent less time working and studying if this is all the time I had.

Does anyone have any advice?",2024-02-05 08:38:16

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

I was looking at housing in Palmer, Butte, and possibly as far south as Eagle River (but I don't know if the commute to Palmer is doable in the winter from there).  


I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",University of Alaska Anchorage vs Fairbanks ,"Hi this is my first reddit post so I apologize if it seems disorienting or confusing to read. I had recently got accepted into both Fairbanks and Anchorage for the fall semester of 2024. I'm 21, Male, from Germany but have moved pretty much everywhere it seems. Arizona, Texas, Nevada, North Carolina, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, Montreal, Milan, Paris, Multiple cities in Germany. I plan on accepting one or the other, as I have been offered instate. I plan on majoring in languages (German/English/Russian) I am even open to majoring in Computer Science.

I don't necessarily have a favorite, I really just want to be social and make some friends while I develope myself into being a better person. One of my concerns falls on healthcare, I have had multiple surgeries done on my lower body that often needs to be checked. I have also been labeled with Hashimotos disease and I have to be checked every couple of months since I'm apparently at a high risk of thyroid cancer. I also have schizophrenia where I need meds and brain scans relatively often. I'll be going into the dorm and will start off not having a car or any gear related to the cold.

Will I absolutely need a car starting off and how much gear/clothes would I need for the environment. I have never really lived in an environment with a lot of snow. I also like to travel a lot and want to experience, hiking, fishing, biking and really want to see the northern lights. I am not afraid to drive distances, I drive all the time and became used to driving 12 hours average in one go. I really want to take Alaska by the balls! Go everywhere and do everything, when I have breaks from school. For context I also don't have any contacts or know anyone or anything about Alaska. 

I also have piercings, some tattoos, black nails and an accent. I don't really care about what people would think but I do like to adapt to my environment and not cause trouble or unnecessary attention. Will any of this be a major issue. Every state I have been too it hasn't been a problem but I have absolutely no clue when based off of Alaska. Also how tall are people in Alaska?

I ALSO FORGOT TO ADD, jobs are very important for me and I'm also willing to work on and off the campus.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

At least you can put blackout curtains up and simulate darkness in your home at night. To me, it seems it would be easier to simulate darkness inside during the summer months than it would be to simulate light outside in the winter months. The constant darkness also seems like it would be straight up depressing after a while. Paired with the extreme cold. I’d actually like to experience the midnight sun in person one day and visit Alaska during the summer. Which extreme do you prefer and why? Thank you 😊 !

Was wondering if anyone could recommend me places to visit(or convince me to completely scrap the entire idea). Was trying to book everything by this weekend and still unsure on whether i should go ahead with it or not, i hope someone can help me decide.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Moving to Dillingham,"I might be moving to Dillingham in the near future for a job opportunity and am looking to learn more about the area. I know that it isn't connected to Alaska by road and that it's expensive to ship anything there.

Where is a good place to find an apartment or home to rent? I've looked everywhere I can think of and have found nothing.

Should I ship my car by barge or just buy a different car when I get to Dillingham? I've heard that I can pack my car full of supplies while shipping it, is that true?

I'm from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado so I'm used to the cold and snow (at least by Colorado standards) and have heard that Dillingham is like a small mountain town. I think my wife and I would like it there.

I have so many questions... Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated!",2023-05-11 17:43:53

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Working in Alaska as a foreing with a college degree / Argentinian M. 32 yo,"Hi All!!

I have the idea of working, traveling and knowing new places far different from my home town.

A while ago I started paying attention to Alaska. With a lot of landscapes and I was intrigued by this cold state.  
I know that a Visa H1B is required to work in the U.S, and I need a employer sponsorship to get it. But I have some other questions I would like to know before putting to work and trying to get the visa. So I join this sub reddit to try to get some data from the Alaska residents themselves if you dont mind.

1) Is it nice to live in Alaska? Regarding the biggest cities like Anchorage o FairBanks ( considering the life costs, money savings, climate and places to know )  
2) How hard is it to get the sponsorship form an emplyoyer? There are job opportunities there?  Knowing that I have a college degree in Product Design and currently working as a project manager.  
3) Socially speaking, are Alaska residents cool people? Is it cool living there?  


Thats it, those I think there are the most important question just to know about a little bit more. Pleas if you consider somenthing else I would be pleased if you tell me.

P.D: I like smoking cannabis every now and then, I´ve read is it legal, is that so?

Thanks!!

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Wheelchair users?,"Hey there, I’m wondering if there are wheelchair accessible places to live or visit in Alaska? What do disabled people who live there do? Is public transit accessible in some cities? Do cold temps etc mess with the usability of power wheelchairs? Is there a culture of helping people out and reciprocity and all? If you can’t use a powerchair in the snow for example, are snow machines reasonable to acquire/use? Alaska seems so beautiful and somewhere I’d really like to be, but I’m not sure if lack of wheelchair accessibility stuff would make it so I’d just be stuck inside and isolated?",2023-10-12 06:14:36

Been living here in Alaska for the last eight months and looking for something *interesting* to do this winter, and I've decided visiting Utqiagvik in the last week of December would be fun. I already know the basics - it's gonna be cold, most stuff probably won't be open, etc. Just curious what I can expect to still be running, if rental cars and taxis will still be a thing. I'd like to go to Point Barrow if possible.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,worried","Family member hiking from Bethel, has hypothermia, rescue unavailable due to high winds","Basically title - a cousin of mine (who has lived in Alaska previously several times) was starting a hike from Bethel, Alaska today towards the Yukon River. They are wearing a tracker. They are about thirteen miles out from Bethel, in the swamplands, and developing hypothermia. Per texts from their immediate family, due to the high winds today, rescuers cannot reach them. I am states away and feeling really helpless and powerless. 

No other family members are in Alaska at this time. Does Bethel have any other options for rescue besides air rescue? Will they/can they hike after him or send rescue dogs? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Please be kind, I don’t know much about Alaska. Thank you.  

Edit: Just heard from them directly. They’re hiking back, hypothermia symptoms are mild right now and they know how to handle the symptoms. The way others were wording it, it came across as if they were dying in a ditch somewhere, so I’m relieved to hear the situation is not that serious. Thank you for all the suggestions. 

Edit 2: He’s still wet and cold and exhausted, but does not want to ask for help or press his panic button. He started hiking back but it took him two days to go the 13 miles and now he’s not feeling well so instead he’s hunkered down for the night. I’m worried for him but we’ll see what happens. 

Final Edit: he was rescued & hospitalized but is safe and is going to be okay. Thanks to the people on this post, your suggestions and phone numbers helped us get him help in time. I really appreciate all of the helpful people on here! ",2024-07-26 14:18:52

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,worried","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,relieved","Family member hiking from Bethel, has hypothermia, rescue unavailable due to high winds","Basically title - a cousin of mine (who has lived in Alaska previously several times) was starting a hike from Bethel, Alaska today towards the Yukon River. They are wearing a tracker. They are about thirteen miles out from Bethel, in the swamplands, and developing hypothermia. Per texts from their immediate family, due to the high winds today, rescuers cannot reach them. I am states away and feeling really helpless and powerless. 

No other family members are in Alaska at this time. Does Bethel have any other options for rescue besides air rescue? Will they/can they hike after him or send rescue dogs? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Please be kind, I don’t know much about Alaska. Thank you.  

Edit: Just heard from them directly. They’re hiking back, hypothermia symptoms are mild right now and they know how to handle the symptoms. The way others were wording it, it came across as if they were dying in a ditch somewhere, so I’m relieved to hear the situation is not that serious. Thank you for all the suggestions. 

Edit 2: He’s still wet and cold and exhausted, but does not want to ask for help or press his panic button. He started hiking back but it took him two days to go the 13 miles and now he’s not feeling well so instead he’s hunkered down for the night. I’m worried for him but we’ll see what happens. 

Final Edit: he was rescued & hospitalized but is safe and is going to be okay. Thanks to the people on this post, your suggestions and phone numbers helped us get him help in time. I really appreciate all of the helpful people on here! ",2024-07-26 14:18:52

I'm looking at two pieces right now, they have different down to waterfowl feathers ratios, for one is pretty much all down, and one is half and half. I have no clue what this means, or if it's that big of a difference to my old coat. 

If anyone could let me know anything about coats I'd really appreciate it! A bit scared for the winter, and I run cold. I already got rabbit fur Italian leather gloves (I don't like wool touching my hands) and thick alpaca socks.",2024-10-01 03:55:00

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,scared",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,scared",Interested in Moving,"Hi!!! I’m interested in moving to Alaska. Let me tell you about myself so you can give me some recommendations. I HATE the cold, it makes me feel so sad and shivery. I also don’t like snow, however I can tolerate it when it is still in the liquid form. All that aside, let me tell you about my favorite hobbies!! I hate skiing, sledding, snowboarding, fishing, Ice fishing, hiking, driving in any condition other than plain concrete, and bending over too much. It hurts my wee little back. On the contrary, I love tanning, surfing, scuba diving, dancing, and parasailing. Let me talk about my fears. Bears are so scary!!! Luckily there are none here right! 😁 Mosquitos scare me too, and so does the dark. Me and my family were looking at Utqiagvik, as i’m sure it has all my likings. What do you think?

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,scared",Does Alaska have a place for people like me?,"Hey, Before we get too deep into it I want to be clear this is not discussing any like...active plans to move to Alaska currently or things of that nature. What this is is me checking both for myself and my girlfriend in a ""what if"" scenario be both favor for our future together. I am looking for serious responses, but nothing urgent.   


Backround: Me and my Girlfriend have gotten quite close in the near 2 years we've known one another, and obviously in that time the idea of where we would go if we moved in together has come up here and there. One place near the top of both of our lists is Alaska. We're both already pretty introverted and isolationist. Personally I think the fresh air and rolling nature would do wonders for both our health problems (myself having a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, autism, and so on. Herself having physical issues with her lungs for example) and shes repeatedly expressed a love for its beauty. (For the record, she generally dislikes the cold. So knowing that and still favoring alaska above all others is a testament to her favor to the state)   


However obviously their are pros and cons to everywhere you go. And your own situation affects that. For instance, Im fully medically disabled, fully collect disability insurance. I currently can't drive and honestly am somewhat scared too. A tendency to be overwhelmed mixing with with rows of 2 ton speed machines is just asking for disaster. As such, I was wondering a few things.  


1:Are their any specific jobs or programs you can enter that can give you work at your own pace. Like say, get you in contact with a fishing boat who needs a one time crew member. Or something else that can generate an income without putting too much pressure. Like can you sell things you hunt/fish for a suitable income? (factoring in social security)   


Everyone knows the basics of Alaska when it comes to climate. Cold, wet, high costs for groceries. But are their any aspects that should be focused on? Like How does the climate change from the north to south of the state? what are the pros and cons for each section (Can other than north to south, like costal vs inland)   


The internet is important to both of us currently. Especially myself as the music works as a great way to help channel my anxiety brain, though my girlfriend also enjoys it for things such as artwork crafting. Is there anything we should consider on that front?   


More for my girlfriend for this question. What kind of crops and plants can you grow? my girlfriend is an avid botanist, which she does for fun but can also be used to help grow food for us. Though of course, I'd want to know what she can expect. Also on that front, she raises rabbits for breeding and eating. Is that also a thing you can do up in  Alaska?  


And final one for now, how do you expect Alaska to be in 10-20-30+ years? As I said before this is not an immediate move, so time is going to have an impact on us all. You can get news from any station about climate change or whatever, but you are the people who actually live in Alaska and experience its highs and lows. So, what do you think it will be like in the years to come?   


Thats it for my questions, though of course if you have ANYTHING you want to say outside of my questions, feel free to add to it! Im looking for anything and everything I can use to potentially plan my far future.   


Either way, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day \^\^",2023-06-07 08:36:28

Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,excited","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,excited","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
Alaska,BOTH,"Cold snap,excited",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I’ve tried googling but I’m super overwhelmed by options, brands, and opinions. Can you help me simplify this? 

- What do I def need? 
- What is worth investing in versus renting? (For instance they offer overboots to rent. Is that a good option or too cold to wear over some basic winter boots?)
- What brands are warm enough and decent quality but still budget friendly? 
- Any other tips to help a desert rat to survive the cold?

Alaska,BOTH,"Overcast,love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Overcast,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
Alaska,BOTH,"Overcast,like",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Alaska,BOTH,"Overcast,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Alaska,BOTH,"Overcast,like",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08

Alaska,BOTH,"Forecast,love",Seeking advice on Kenai Fjords boat tour in bad weather,"Hiya locals and thank you for having me - it took me way too long to get here but your lovely state is the last one I needed to check off on my visit to all 50! Huzzah!

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

Alaska,BOTH,"Forecast,like","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Forecast,like",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

Alaska,BOTH,"Forecast,worried","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Forecast,excited","Visiting Alaska (Fairbanks) for the first time Dec 8-11, from SoCal. Advice needed.","Bringing my wife for our anniversary to Fairbanks to show her the northern lights. She has been very excited as this is our first ever trip for anniversary. I want to make sure that I check all the boxes and don't get bogged down by the weather. The weather seems scary (-20 deg C). Not sure what's the best way to prepare without having to spend too much for what's essentially a one time wear. Also, is there a way to know beforehand if we even have a chance of catching the Aurora borealis. The 27 day forecast shows that KP index is at 2 during that time which is like very low solar activity. That means very low aurora visibility. Is my understanding correct?   
Lastly, if we want to drive around, should I rent an AWD SUV or a AWD sedan works fine?   


Thank you very much. 

Edit: thank you all for helping out a novice with such patience. Hopefully, this thread will serve as and advice for people trying to visit Fairbanks in early December.  ",2023-11-28 19:09:05
Alaska,BOTH,"Polar vortex,love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

Alaska,BOTH,"Polar vortex,enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Alaska,BOTH,"Polar vortex,like",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth.

Alaska,BOTH,"Polar vortex,like",Midnight sun or polar night?,"As a non-Alaskan, I’m fascinated by the extremes of Alaska when it comes to lengths of daylight or lack thereof. AKA polar night and midnight sun. I know neither is ideal, but which do you prefer? I personally think I would rather deal with the midnight sun. At least you can put blackout curtains up and simulate darkness in your home at night. To me, it seems it would be easier to simulate darkness inside during the summer months than it would be to simulate light outside in the winter months. The constant darkness also seems like it would be straight up depressing after a while. Paired with the extreme cold. I’d actually like to experience the midnight sun in person one day and visit Alaska during the summer. Which extreme do you prefer and why? Thank you 😊 !

Alaska,BOTH,"Polar vortex,like",I put together an overview of Project Willow and what both sides are saying,"The Biden administration has approved a modified version of the Willow Master Development Plan in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The approval allows ConocoPhillips to proceed with the project with a reduction from five to three drill sites and the relinquishment of 68,000 acres of current leases. [U.S. Department of the Interior](https://doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-substantially-reduces-scope-willow-project)

A bipartisan effort in Alaska itself encouraged approval of the project primarily citing energy security, job creation, and economic stimulation as valuable outcomes. Certain local environmental groups expressed disappointment, saying the project will negatively effect the climate, biodiversity, and local communities. Alaskan Native groups had differing reactions, with some saying the project will bring numerous benefits to locals and others criticising environmental impacts of the project.

* “The Willow project is a roughly $7 billion proposal from ConocoPhillips to drill oil and gas in Alaska. It would be located inside the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a 23 million-acre (93 million-hectare) area on the state’s North Slope that is the largest tract of undisturbed public land in the United States.” [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/willow-oil-gas-project-alaska-sparks-green-opposition-2023-03-03/)
* “According to environmental impact statements published by the federal government, if the oil produced by Willow is burned, it would create 260 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.” [Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2023/02/21/alaska-house-votes-unanimously-to-support-willow-oil-project/)

From the Left

The Left focuses on Biden’s attempt to balance concerns around climate change with energy security and economic stimulation. Disputes between Native groups with differing opinions are also highlighted, and environmental groups’ concerns are noted.

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,love","Ever just sit there and think ""wow, I live in Alaska""?","I was born here, lived here 35 years - my whole life - though I was on foreign exchange to Germany for a year in high school.

I have a core memory that contains a feeling I've had many times since it happened. One day as my parents were driving me to the elementary school I went to. I looked at the mountains, as I had many times before, and thought something along the lines of ""Wow. I live in Alaska. Most people view Alaska as a special place, and I live here. The place I live is so different from most people, and so majestic."" I was thinking of people in the US as a whole at the time, rather than globally, and obviously my thoughts were not as verbose, but that was the vibe of them. They happened every time I was on that ride to school, and they regularly happen to this day when I'm outdoors and look at my surroundings. Not every day, but frequent enough.

Ever just bask in the uniqueness of the place we live, no matter how ordinary it is to you? Did anyone else who grew up here have that realization one day, that you're not growing up or living in some generic place, you're in *Alaska*? A place that to my elementary school mind not only was the *only* place I knew, but was also fabled in the readings and teachings I absorbed as a child. It's like one day I connected those dots and haven't been able to shake it since.

When I lived abroad on exchange, that feeling was just amplified. I was absolutely stunned and mindblown by the sights in Germany. Just gazing at ancient buildings in absolute wonder, staring at actual skyscrapers in Frankfurt and feeling smaller than I've ever felt (even more than when viewing a mountain many times bigger, just because the skyscraper is manmade and surrounded by other skyscrapers and tall buildings). So much more, too. 

However, my interactions with the people I encountered solidly reinforced my feeling that my true home was a special place. When I told people where I was from, they always reacted in a special way they didn't do for people from other places. Often something starting with the equivalent of ""oh wow, that's so awesome"" acting like they just ran into someone from a strange and wondrous land. Nothing too extreme, but an obvious acknowledgement that you're not from some typical or expected place - and it's a place they know about and have heard tales of.

I fucking love this state and don't want to live anywhere else, no matter how much I like other places. There's just something about simply being here that is so special. Anyone else feel that?

Just posting this because I felt this feeling and felt like writing about it. I'm not bashing other places - they have their own uniqueness and great qualities, but I just love where we live.",2024-09-27 18:00:24

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

'Alaska USA Federal Credit Union
Dear Member,

We are proud to announce that on April 3, 2023, Alaska USA Federal Credit Union will be changing its name to Global Federal Credit Union. This name change, the fourth name change in our company’s history, marks a significant milestone in our credit union’s journey, providing an opportunity to reflect on everything that Alaska USA has stood for and everything that we aspire to become as we move forward into an exciting future.

This new brand name is a better description of a membership that is distributed worldwide and more illustrative of our organizational commitment to accessibility anytime, anywhere in the world. We recognize that many of our members, like me, were born and raised in Alaska and have had accounts at Alaska USA for a long time. I want to assure you that the credit union is still Alaskan to our core; Alaska is in our DNA. When you walk into a branch you’ll be greeted by the same employees, use the same accounts, and experience the same commitment to the financial wellbeing of our communities that you’ve come to expect from us. Global is simply a new name with the same Alaskan spirit and values that have always guided us.

Our subsidiary companies are also adopting the Global name. Alaska USA Insurance Brokers will be known as Global Credit Union Insurance Brokers, and Alaska USA Mortgage Company will be known as Global Credit Union Home Loans.

Since we were founded in 1948 as Alaskan Air Depot Federal Credit Union, our organization has expanded far beyond the confines of the Air Depot and the borders of Alaska. As your families grew, we grew. We now have members in all 50 states and all over the world. We have branches in Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Washington, and even on military bases in Italy. We’ve grown to become what Alaska always has been—larger than life. Global.

I am excited to be on this journey with you and look forward to serving your financial needs for many years to come. We truly believe there is Strength in Members.

With great appreciation,

Global Credit Union'
Just got an email that As of April 3, AK USA will now be 'Global Federal Credit Union'. The last few months their phone customer service has seemingly become largely pushed to out of state people that are as unhelpful as other banks. I have loved this Credit Union for 10+ years, and now am sad to have to move my accounts elsewhere because even the news of the change has made it obvious how the last few months of horrible CS and other policy changes are due to this new change. Just a heads up to all that use them, that things are changing, have been changing, and it isn't for us Alaskans.

Not all calls have gone to out of state, that was a false absolute statement, I should have instead said that a majority of my recent calls have gone to out of state folks that have had a completely different attitude than the locals.  Can I be mad at a business for making moves to make more money? Nah. Can I feel a large sense of frustration and almost betrayal from new rules etc and CS interactions that have led me to believe that this rebranding is to make more money, get more customers etc all while no longer having the same consistency of amazing service? Absolutey I can, and it comes from history of what happens to companies when they expand. 

It's the end of an era, and to act differently is being unwilling to use logic and examples to see exactly where this is now heading.",2023-01-19 23:36:37

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I do get full benefits and a relocation package of like 7.5k. I been seeing a few postings on the housing Facebook page. Dunno if it changes anything….

 my main concerns are still transportation (from city to city. Someone says it’s 30 minutes by plane to and from Juneau but cost wise I don’t wanna pay 100+ for recreational sports which already will be costly.) 

Sitka is apparently too warm for recreation? However I saw someone say it’s not for those who are NOT adventurous. I enjoy hiking, I want to try new things and get out but I do NOT wanna be trapped in doors all day also I suppose to idea of constant rain is also not pleasant to think about.

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like","Ever just sit there and think ""wow, I live in Alaska""?","I was born here, lived here 35 years - my whole life - though I was on foreign exchange to Germany for a year in high school.

I have a core memory that contains a feeling I've had many times since it happened. One day as my parents were driving me to the elementary school I went to. I looked at the mountains, as I had many times before, and thought something along the lines of ""Wow. I live in Alaska. Most people view Alaska as a special place, and I live here. The place I live is so different from most people, and so majestic."" I was thinking of people in the US as a whole at the time, rather than globally, and obviously my thoughts were not as verbose, but that was the vibe of them. They happened every time I was on that ride to school, and they regularly happen to this day when I'm outdoors and look at my surroundings. Not every day, but frequent enough.

Ever just bask in the uniqueness of the place we live, no matter how ordinary it is to you? Did anyone else who grew up here have that realization one day, that you're not growing up or living in some generic place, you're in *Alaska*? A place that to my elementary school mind not only was the *only* place I knew, but was also fabled in the readings and teachings I absorbed as a child. It's like one day I connected those dots and haven't been able to shake it since.

When I lived abroad on exchange, that feeling was just amplified. I was absolutely stunned and mindblown by the sights in Germany. Just gazing at ancient buildings in absolute wonder, staring at actual skyscrapers in Frankfurt and feeling smaller than I've ever felt (even more than when viewing a mountain many times bigger, just because the skyscraper is manmade and surrounded by other skyscrapers and tall buildings). So much more, too. 

However, my interactions with the people I encountered solidly reinforced my feeling that my true home was a special place. When I told people where I was from, they always reacted in a special way they didn't do for people from other places. Often something starting with the equivalent of ""oh wow, that's so awesome"" acting like they just ran into someone from a strange and wondrous land. Nothing too extreme, but an obvious acknowledgement that you're not from some typical or expected place - and it's a place they know about and have heard tales of.

I fucking love this state and don't want to live anywhere else, no matter how much I like other places. There's just something about simply being here that is so special. Anyone else feel that?

Just posting this because I felt this feeling and felt like writing about it. I'm not bashing other places - they have their own uniqueness and great qualities, but I just love where we live.",2024-09-27 18:00:24
Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like",I’m homeless and losing hope ,"I recently moved from wasilla to anchorage after falling on hard times and becoming homeless about 2 months ago. My girlfriend and I are both living in my tiny ford focus and it’s been rough.

I’ve had a hard past and had made some mistakes but am now on the straight and narrow. Neither of us use drugs and we both got full time jobs less than a week after moving here. We work retail and have managed to save around $2000 and are currently looking for housing. I’m contemplating staying at a shitty motel since I’ve been wasting money on application fees on apartments. I’ve applied for 5 now and have been turned down each time due to my record. No felonies but theres been some mistakes.

Ive changed since then and learned from my mistakes. I’m a good person, I try to do good and help those around me and stay far away from trouble now. I have no family or friends out here and I’m starting to lose hope. Maybe I’m just destined to live like this forever and it won’t get better.  I feel like anybody should get a second chance and I feel like I’ve been making all the right and healthy decisions lately but it’s hard to stay positive.

I just reaching out in case anyone knows of any housing or any communities that could help us. We have food stamps and our work is letting us stay in the parking lot to sleep. We use the food pantry to get food every now and then. I just want a roof over my head before it gets too cold. I’m tired of feeling judged and looked down upon or like I’m a drug addict because I’ve fallen on hard times. Being homeless is not easy. Constantly trying to find time to shower and what to eat, or where to sleep, wondering if I’ll ever be able to find housing, staying warm. Our eating habits are terrible right now. No hot food except fast food and it’s destroying my stomach. And working 40+ hours a week at a shitty retail store on top of that with no bed to come home to.

I hope all of my hard work pays off soon because I’m starting to lose hope. If anyone could help or give me any advice I’d be grateful. Peace ✌️",2024-09-08 06:52:12

They don’t deserve to freeze to death. I see a lot of individuals in sleeping bags or even on the ground. If they miss curfew or the shelter is full, they really have no where to go and struggle to stay warm. Some do have jobs but cannot get housing. 

I am wondering if there is a laundromat that does tokens or gift vouchers in Anchorage, that is somewhat centrally located. I would like to give them a “load of clean laundry”.

I have the following on my list: 

Hats 
Gloves 
Socks
Beanies 
Hot hands warmer
Hot feet warmers
Foil blankets 
Feminine hygiene products 
Condoms 
Shower wipes 
Flushable wipes 
Tide pods
Cup of Noodles (microwaveable) 

Anything I should add ? 

Edit: I added toothpaste, toothbrush, first aid kits, deodorant to my Amazon cart. I am thinking I will buy small bottles or containers and filling them with shampoo/conditioner/body wash 

I don’t plan on going into “homeless” camps. I have “regulars” I see on my patrols that sleep in doorways and cars. These are the people I’d like to help immediately. I feel terrible asking individuals to leave back into the cold.

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like",How to walk in Anchorage without freezing to death? No car.,"Hello this december I will be in Anchorage for this winter. 

I am wondering how tu survive without car. My friends can give me a ride to go groceries or some important places. But I don't want to abuse. However they are very nice and kind. 

Be a pedestrian in Anchorage was all an adventure this summer and I imagine that this winter will be a horror with inches and inches of snow. I am afraid I don't want to freezing to death waiting People Mover (Bus) or walking for example 15 or 30 minutes. Or fall on the slippery floor.

I was two times in Alaska. This summer and last march.  I am from European Union. We went to walk all places and the distances are more short. 

People recommended don't bring snow clothes from my country and get in Alaska. I will take the minimous to be warm. T-shirts and thermal pants. And I will dress in layers like an onion.

Indont want that..just to he left alone mostly
Just want a quiet warm place to maybe chill tell I die. 

But also maybe open up a small business like a pizza place, burgers or mexican food? Anything like that needed in a small towns? I come from a city of 408, and its not remote enough for me. 

I do recognize its its hard to live in some areas, but maybe I want that? I wont know tell I do..

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

And secondly, given that same window of time, and that the main goal is catching auroras, what would you recommend someone to go and see or experience while in Alaska?

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,like",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

'Alaska USA Federal Credit Union
Dear Member,

We are proud to announce that on April 3, 2023, Alaska USA Federal Credit Union will be changing its name to Global Federal Credit Union. This name change, the fourth name change in our company’s history, marks a significant milestone in our credit union’s journey, providing an opportunity to reflect on everything that Alaska USA has stood for and everything that we aspire to become as we move forward into an exciting future.

This new brand name is a better description of a membership that is distributed worldwide and more illustrative of our organizational commitment to accessibility anytime, anywhere in the world. We recognize that many of our members, like me, were born and raised in Alaska and have had accounts at Alaska USA for a long time. I want to assure you that the credit union is still Alaskan to our core; Alaska is in our DNA. When you walk into a branch you’ll be greeted by the same employees, use the same accounts, and experience the same commitment to the financial wellbeing of our communities that you’ve come to expect from us. Global is simply a new name with the same Alaskan spirit and values that have always guided us.

Our subsidiary companies are also adopting the Global name. Alaska USA Insurance Brokers will be known as Global Credit Union Insurance Brokers, and Alaska USA Mortgage Company will be known as Global Credit Union Home Loans.

Since we were founded in 1948 as Alaskan Air Depot Federal Credit Union, our organization has expanded far beyond the confines of the Air Depot and the borders of Alaska. As your families grew, we grew. We now have members in all 50 states and all over the world. We have branches in Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Washington, and even on military bases in Italy. We’ve grown to become what Alaska always has been—larger than life. Global.

I am excited to be on this journey with you and look forward to serving your financial needs for many years to come. We truly believe there is Strength in Members.

With great appreciation,

Global Credit Union'
Just got an email that As of April 3, AK USA will now be 'Global Federal Credit Union'. The last few months their phone customer service has seemingly become largely pushed to out of state people that are as unhelpful as other banks. I have loved this Credit Union for 10+ years, and now am sad to have to move my accounts elsewhere because even the news of the change has made it obvious how the last few months of horrible CS and other policy changes are due to this new change. Just a heads up to all that use them, that things are changing, have been changing, and it isn't for us Alaskans.

Not all calls have gone to out of state, that was a false absolute statement, I should have instead said that a majority of my recent calls have gone to out of state folks that have had a completely different attitude than the locals.  Can I be mad at a business for making moves to make more money? Nah. Can I feel a large sense of frustration and almost betrayal from new rules etc and CS interactions that have led me to believe that this rebranding is to make more money, get more customers etc all while no longer having the same consistency of amazing service? Absolutey I can, and it comes from history of what happens to companies when they expand.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,worried","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,worried",Best layers and sleeping bag for end of June outside Anchorage?,"My teen is spending a week camping with a guide/ group of other teens at the end of June and I'm just trying to get recommendations for what layers are most comfortable for the swing in temps and mosquitoes? They'll be a couple hours outside of Anchorage, and they're doing the typical outdoorsy activities, a smaller hike, group team building we might expect to see for a teen summer trip. He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm. We do need to be budget conscious, he's on scholarship we aren't ""just"" putting him on a plane to Alaska for a week lol, but I'm also not worried about whether we'll ever use the gear again, my 12 yo goes camping with scouts frequently so things will get used.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

'Alaska USA Federal Credit Union
Dear Member,

We are proud to announce that on April 3, 2023, Alaska USA Federal Credit Union will be changing its name to Global Federal Credit Union. This name change, the fourth name change in our company’s history, marks a significant milestone in our credit union’s journey, providing an opportunity to reflect on everything that Alaska USA has stood for and everything that we aspire to become as we move forward into an exciting future.

This new brand name is a better description of a membership that is distributed worldwide and more illustrative of our organizational commitment to accessibility anytime, anywhere in the world. We recognize that many of our members, like me, were born and raised in Alaska and have had accounts at Alaska USA for a long time. I want to assure you that the credit union is still Alaskan to our core; Alaska is in our DNA. When you walk into a branch you’ll be greeted by the same employees, use the same accounts, and experience the same commitment to the financial wellbeing of our communities that you’ve come to expect from us. Global is simply a new name with the same Alaskan spirit and values that have always guided us.

Our subsidiary companies are also adopting the Global name. Alaska USA Insurance Brokers will be known as Global Credit Union Insurance Brokers, and Alaska USA Mortgage Company will be known as Global Credit Union Home Loans.

Since we were founded in 1948 as Alaskan Air Depot Federal Credit Union, our organization has expanded far beyond the confines of the Air Depot and the borders of Alaska. As your families grew, we grew. We now have members in all 50 states and all over the world. We have branches in Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Washington, and even on military bases in Italy. We’ve grown to become what Alaska always has been—larger than life. Global.

I am excited to be on this journey with you and look forward to serving your financial needs for many years to come. We truly believe there is Strength in Members.

With great appreciation,

Global Credit Union'
Just got an email that As of April 3, AK USA will now be 'Global Federal Credit Union'. The last few months their phone customer service has seemingly become largely pushed to out of state people that are as unhelpful as other banks. I have loved this Credit Union for 10+ years, and now am sad to have to move my accounts elsewhere because even the news of the change has made it obvious how the last few months of horrible CS and other policy changes are due to this new change. Just a heads up to all that use them, that things are changing, have been changing, and it isn't for us Alaskans.

Edit since the AK USA FCU employee wanted to chime in while not being an AK USA FCU employee.

Not all calls have gone to out of state, that was a false absolute statement, I should have instead said that a majority of my recent calls have gone to out of state folks that have had a completely different attitude than the locals.  Can I be mad at a business for making moves to make more money? Nah. Can I feel a large sense of frustration and almost betrayal from new rules etc and CS interactions that have led me to believe that this rebranding is to make more money, get more customers etc all while no longer having the same consistency of amazing service? Absolutey I can, and it comes from history of what happens to companies when they expand. 

It's the end of an era, and to act differently is being unwilling to use logic and examples to see exactly where this is now heading.",2023-01-19 23:36:37

A lot of the heavy rain gear is going to be barged up with some family friends who are doing the same. I leave at the end of the month. Can any of you residents of the islands give some advice? Anything that would make my stay there more comfortable? Necessities? Nice to haves? Anything to avoid while I’m up there?

Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,excited","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
Alaska,BOTH,"Global warming,excited",Seeking Bone-hunters for our documentary,"Hi guys! 

We're embarking on an exciting journey to capture the story of the ""Bone Rush"" in North America and specifically Alaska, a documentary that aims to raise environmental awareness and shed light on the importance of preserving the valuable remnants of the Pleistocene era. But we need your help!

We're on the lookout for passionate ice-age fossil bone hunters located in Alaska, British Colombia or Seattle area who are willing to share their remarkable work and be interviewed for our documentary. These individuals play a vital role in unearthing the secrets of our ancient past, and we believe their stories deserve to be heard.

If you know any ice-age fossil bone hunters, or perhaps you are one yourself, we would love to connect with you! This is an incredible opportunity to showcase your expertise, contribute to environmental conservation, and inspire others through your discoveries.

Whether you've stumbled upon mammoth tusks or discovered other fascinating Pleistocene fossils, we want to hear from you. Your knowledge and experiences can help educate a global audience about the significance of preserving these precious remnants.

So, if you or someone you know fits could be of any help, please reach out to us through direct message or by leaving a comment below. Thank you in advance for your help! Stay tuned for updates and exciting content!

North Dakota,BOTH,"weather,love","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2.

I'm a 31 year old male, born and raised in central Arkansas and never left much. I have a felony and I'm on disability for my autism and CPTSD, I own a 2008 Honda Shadow 750 and a 2001 Honda Accord.  Next September me and my fiancee are moving to North Dakota, likely Towner, Minot, or the surrounding area. (Fiancee and their family are from there)

I'm VERY used to Arkansan ""country"" folks, having ""nothing to do"" (ie clubs fairs arcades etc) but I'm fairly well addicted to the internet and videogames (Side money I make also involves computers, 3D printing)
I'm also used to HOT very humid (mid to high 80% on average) summers.

I guess what I'm asking out of this post is a decently detailed list of important things I should keep in mind when moving up north. Basic changes in heat/cold maintenance for the home and vehicle, basic care tips for them in cold weather,  what type of wile life to look out for, if these towns or the ones near them have decent reliable internet connections (500mbps) and more importantly what to expect as far as person-to-person interaction. For reference, when I say ""I'm autistic"" I don't mean I'm slightly on the spectrum, I mean it's the primary reason for my inability to work, so much so I literally cannot naturally read facial emotion.

North Dakota,BOTH,"hot,like",Hot Take: “Charitable Gaming “ is a racket,"I know this might be controversial, but I’ve pondered this for a long time. Here are the facts:

1. Many of the charities participation in gaming is contradictory to their mission. (Example: Sharehouse, an addiction treatment center that works with people struggling with alcohol and gaming addiction makes money off of gambling at a bar)

2. A lot of the charities aren’t actually charities. (Example: Plains Art Museum, West Fargo Hockey)

Personally, I believe it has gotten out of hand. We now have things like the “wall of honor” that doesn’t seem to actually pass funds on to veterans. It’s literally just a tv in bars.

I don’t believe there’s much “charity” in “charitable gaming.” What do you guys think?",2023-03-19 18:32:34

North Dakota,BOTH,"cold,love","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

I’ve been told by locals that it would be a very bad idea, and to not do it, it’d be near impossible to live there without a car.

My bf is a mechanic and where he was offered a job I can’t seem to find any houses to rent so I’m thinking it’s not a good area and was wondering if there were better opportunities in other parts of the state. Second question is about finding places to rent. Like I said previously I can’t find any decent places to rent around the Williston area. I have looked on fb marketplace in the area to see if there were better options than Zillow and nothing. I’m not sure where else to look really and saw on another Reddit post response to ask the locals so I thought I would give it a shot asking on here and seeing if there were any other places I could look. For ppl that are curious yes I know it gets cold in ND and I am perfectly ok with that, as I get older it is harder to deal with the Texas heat and I really need a change of scenery.

North Dakota,BOTH,"cold,like",Best place for car mechanic jobs in North Dakota? ,"Hi, thinking of moving to North Dakota from Ireland. I’m looking for the best places in North Dakota to get employment as a mechanic. Experienced with both petrol (gas) & diesel. Cars, SUVs, vans, light trucks etc. never worked on HGVs just things up to 7.5 tons. Mostly worked on German & Japanese brands both in factories in Germany (and a short stint with the German employer in a plant in the US reworking production faults) and in main dealers in Ireland. Currently working mostly on light commercial vehicles (farm & construction SUVs & pickups, delivery vans, small delivery trucks) ideally where I’d be going should have reasonable pastureland within an hour because my wife is, well we don’t distinguish & call all Agri people farmers but in American terms you’d be talking homesteader/small rancher. Horses & beef so it doesn’t need to be dairy or cropping quality land. 

The reason we are considering this is to get away from our families & start fresh, we are mostly attracted by the low population & low cost of living but neither of us like the kind of heat you’d find in places like Texas. We don’t mind cold though. Proximity to the Canadian border is also a sell because it’s easier/cheaper to live ship horses into Canada & transport by road into America & she would like to bring some of her best breeding stock with her before selling out the rest at home. I know some people might wonder because we are looking at one of the whiter states but we aren’t racist so we don’t mind areas where a lot of people of other races live we are very accepting.

North Dakota,BOTH,"cold,worried","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32
North Dakota,BOTH,"freezing,like",Winter Funerals?,"Ok, hear me out.  

On another group, completely unrelated,  someone remarked that having a deceased person in the morgue or mortuary, refrigerated long term, was highly unlikely.  

Now, in situations like mass casualty events like Katrina, 9-11, even covid  - yes of course, it does happen.

I explained what I'd been told that here in ND, small town cemeteries don't dig graves during ""the freeze"" - because most small cemeteries still hand dig?  Also, it's not uncommon for a bunch of ""spring funerals"" for folks who died over winter (whether it's burying the body or cremated ashes).

One dude thinks I'm FoS.  But I've seen this several times in the 3 years we have lived in rural ND.

So how often DOES this happen in rural communities without ""commercial"" or perpetual care cemeteries?",2024-08-27 20:21:47

Hello.

Hoping I am able to post this here, I am fairly new to Reddit. So --- An opportunity to work in the USA has been sent my way. They have highlighted Bismarck, North Dakota as a possibility and now the ball is in my court, so to speak. I've been down a Google rabbit hole and spoken to an American friend of mine to sus out the potential of the 12 month move. I've gathered a lot of information about the technicalities and what it would entail on a practical level, however I think the glaring issue I have is if I can 'fit in' over there. I am ready for a change and have always wanted to visit North America at some point but, generally speaking, is it easy to make friends? I worry about becoming a hermit. I am a 31 year old woman with no partner or kids (can be seen as a pro or a con tbh) and I enjoy hiking and travel. I have confidence with work but when it comes to life outside of that in a new country, it makes me bloody nervous. Basically, would someone from overseas be welcomed? What are Bismarck-ians (?) like?",2023-11-10 21:52:58
North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Jobs in ND,"I am fleeing Seattle and am considering ND or SD. ND tends to rank really high on quality of life metrics. One of the things that are most important for me when moving is obviously jobs. I work in Sales and Recruiting (but I’m open to change careers). What is the job market like in Fargo?
I also saw that Forbes ranks ND as the best place to open a business, I am happy but it does baffle me a little. What kind of businesses are they opening in ND? The population is pretty low so I’d imagine it’s harder to run a business with less customers for everything. I’d love to open a business later on so this is also quite important.

Anyways, please let me know what to expect in terms of jobs

North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,love",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05
North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,love",The Strangest Boost of Productivity at That One Coffee Shop in Fargo ,"This might sound a bit odd, but has anyone else noticed those strangely productive days where everything just clicks perfectly? It hit me the other day while I was working from Atomic Coffee in downtown Fargo. Typically, Mondays are such a drag for me, but this time it felt like the stars had aligned and tasks that usually take ages were completed in no time.

  
I'm wondering if it's something unique to our local vibe or even specific spots. I’ve tried replicating the same conditions since then—same table by the window, getting my usual iced latte—but haven’t quite achieved that zen-like fous again. 

  
Have you experienced similar productivity bursts here around town? Could it be tied to certain places, diet changes (maybe all that North Dakota farmland goodness?), or perhaps even mental state shifts? Would love to hear your thoughts on what could possibly explain these super-productive spurts! Any tips or favorite spots you'd recommend for making workdays fly by?”",2024-08-27 16:14:47

Hopefully they can do right by the staff in the meantime. Interested to see what shakes out.",2023-04-03 21:00:06

North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,like","Measure 2, Pissing on the will of the voters 3.0","Measure 2. 

It's the latest attempt by the Legislature to sabotage the ballot initiative process and piss on the will of the voters. It's their 3rd attempt after 2 failed atrempts. Nobody asked for this. They must be getting angry because the voters approved ideas they don't like, like term limits and age limits. They certainly don't like seeing things on the ballot like marijuana legalization or ending property taxes

Constitutional Measure 2 

The short version is they want the voters to approve it TWICE, at the primary and the general election. They want to increase the number of required signatures by nearly 8,000. They want to change who can collect signatures. They want to fuck with the fiscal note to influence voters AND add the single subject rule. The single subject was used in South Dakota to kill the marijuana legalization measure they passed in 2020.

This makes ballot measures extremely hard to get on the ballot.  To qualify for the primary,  it pushes the timeline back to get on the June primary. And since they want to increase the number of required signatures and ban out of state collectors, we won't see any future ballot measures. They can influence the election by fucking with the fiscal note. But if the voters still pass a measure, they can invalidate the results by claiming it wasn't a single subject,  like they did on South Dakota for marijuana legalization 

This is an awful ballot measure.  Not sure why anyone would vote to amend the constitution to take away their rights. They must be hoping turnout is low and people won't do their homework

Hello.

Hoping I am able to post this here, I am fairly new to Reddit. So --- An opportunity to work in the USA has been sent my way. They have highlighted Bismarck, North Dakota as a possibility and now the ball is in my court, so to speak. I've been down a Google rabbit hole and spoken to an American friend of mine to sus out the potential of the 12 month move. I've gathered a lot of information about the technicalities and what it would entail on a practical level, however I think the glaring issue I have is if I can 'fit in' over there. I am ready for a change and have always wanted to visit North America at some point but, generally speaking, is it easy to make friends? I worry about becoming a hermit. I am a 31 year old woman with no partner or kids (can be seen as a pro or a con tbh) and I enjoy hiking and travel. I have confidence with work but when it comes to life outside of that in a new country, it makes me bloody nervous. Basically, would someone from overseas be welcomed? What are Bismarck-ians (?) like?",2023-11-10 21:52:58
North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,like",Jobs in ND,"I am fleeing Seattle and am considering ND or SD. ND tends to rank really high on quality of life metrics. One of the things that are most important for me when moving is obviously jobs. I work in Sales and Recruiting (but I’m open to change careers). What is the job market like in Fargo?
I also saw that Forbes ranks ND as the best place to open a business, I am happy but it does baffle me a little. What kind of businesses are they opening in ND? The population is pretty low so I’d imagine it’s harder to run a business with less customers for everything. I’d love to open a business later on so this is also quite important.

Anyways, please let me know what to expect in terms of jobs

North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,like",Just moved to North Dakota,"Hello, I’ve just moved into a rental house for school. This is my first time moving in a house other than my parents, and I have some concerns. If you have any suggestions for handling these while maintaining a good relationship with the realty company, or if you know a better subreddit to ask for help, I would appreciate it!

1. The basement takes on water after raining. I called the office, and they sent someone to clean it. I’m concerned that it may lead to mold or other problems, and think we need to examine the gutters, or maybe bring in dirt to change the slope of the backyard. 

2. Some of the windows are problematic. Some don’t lock, most are unable to stay open, one is cracked slightly. I want to ask them to do repairs / replacements as needed, but don’t want them to raise rent, just re establish safety and comfort. How should I approach this?

3. The deck needs to be re stained. My thought here is that I could ask the office to let me handle it, and reduce the cost of materials from our rent. 

Do you guys have any other move in tips? The realtor has set up most utilities for us, and they are remodeling our kitchen in the fall. Thank you in advance!

Edit: the floor of one of the bathrooms is warped, like uneven. I’m assuming it’s just from the house settling, so I haven’t flagged it as a concern yet. The house was built in the 70’s ",2024-06-19 01:46:40

Basic changes in heat/cold maintenance for the home and vehicle, basic care tips for them in cold weather,  what type of wile life to look out for, if these towns or the ones near them have decent reliable internet connections (500mbps) and more importantly what to expect as far as person-to-person interaction.

North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,like",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05
North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,like",legislative tax relief,"I'm in Fargo and just got my ""This Is Not A Bill""  tax statement. One again, up $300. Between specials (new streetlights, new streets and sidewalks) and re-assessments I am now at just under $3000 (my AGI last year was $38000 but I have to pay SS taxes myself on $7000 which was 1099 income).

My question is about the legislative tax relief at the top of the statement. For 2023 it's $1074. But this ""relief"" doesn't get subtracted anywhere. Does this mean that without this relief I'd be paying over $4000? Is this like the compensation statement my employer issues which adds their contribution to insurance premiums and 401k to make my earnings look bigger?

Edit: house is fully paid for, at least, so I own it outright. . . . well, I own it as long as I pay my taxes I guess.

&#x200B;

2nd edit: I did get homestead relief a couple of years since I am over 65, my 2022 income went too high (it was over 40k that year). Looks like they have increased ceilings for that so I might get it again. Do I apply by February of 2024 for relief on 2023 taxes paid in 2024? Is that how it works? They don't really spell it out. Seems odd since the first payment is due Feb 15, not like it provides time to process the change if you don't get it in well before. I don't remember how it worked the two times I had it.

Before Krabbenhoft was let go and the Intermountain merger was still in play he made some kind of public statement about how the entire purpose was to expand their insurance products to a larger customer base.

North Dakota,BOTH,"Climate change,worried","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

I'm trying to track down possible regions where people pronounce the word 'battery' using 2 syllables (ba-tree) instead of the standard 3 (bat-er-ee).   Like saying the word 'mattress' using a long *'e'* instead of *'ess'*.    ***The car doesn't start.  I think it needs a new battery.***

[https://aflcio.org/reports/death-job-toll-neglect-2023](https://aflcio.org/reports/death-job-toll-neglect-2023)

**The High Toll of Job Injuries, Illnesses and Deaths In 2021:** 

* 343 workers died each day from hazardous working conditions.
* 5,190 workers were killed on the job in the United States.
* An estimated 120,000 workers died from occupational diseases.
* The job fatality rate increased to 3.6 per 100,000 workers.
* Black workers died on the job at the highest rate in more than a decade.
* Latino workers continue to be at greater risk of dying on the job than all workers.
* Employers reported nearly 3.2 million work-related injuries and illnesses.
* The true impact of COVID-19 infections due to workplace exposures is unknown.
* Limited data show that more than 1.5 million nursing home workers  have been infected with COVID-19 and more than 3,000 have died.
* Workplace violence, musculoskeletal disorders from repetitive  motion injuries and occupational heat illness continue to be major  problems, but data no longer is reported annually to track and  understand these important issues.
* Underreporting is widespread—the true toll of work-related injuries  and illnesses is 5.4 million to 8.1 million each year in private  industry.

The cost of job injuries and illnesses is enormous—estimated at $174 billion to $348 billion a year.

**States with the highest fatality rates in 2021 were:**

* Wyoming (10.4 per 100,000 workers)
* **North Dakota (9.0 per 100,000 workers)**
* Montana (8.0 per 100,000 workers)
* Louisiana (7.7 per 100,000 workers)
* Alaska (6.2 per 100,000 workers)
* New Mexico (6.2 per 100,000 workers)

Industries with the highest fatality rates in 2021 were:

* Agriculture, forestry, and fishing and hunting (19.5 per 100,000 workers)
* Transportation and warehousing (14.5 per 100,000 workers)
* Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (14.2 per 100,000 workers)
* Construction (9.4 per 100,000 workers)
* Wholesale trade (5.1 per 100,000 workers)

Black and Latino workers are more likely to die on the job:

* The Black worker fatality rate of 4.0 per 100,000 workers increased  sharply in 2021 from 3.5 in 2020; this rate is now the highest in more  than a decade.
* 653 Black workers died on the job, the highest number in at least 19 years.
* The Latino fatality rate is still disproportionate to the overall  job fatality rate, at 4.5 per 100,000 workers in 2021—25% higher than  the national average, and marking a 13% increase over the past decade.
* The number of Latino worker deaths in 2021 increased slightly from  the previous year: 1,130 deaths in 2021, compared with 1,072 in 2020. Of  those who died in 2021, 64% were immigrants.

They try to scare the public by comparing the state constitution with the US Constitution. It's not the same at all and the US Constitution overrides the state anyways. The State Constitution already has stupid shit in it.

Here's the plan. If this is approved by the ND voters in 2024....

1. A ballot measure would have to be approved twice, at both the June primary and November general election
2. Increase the percentage from 4% to 5%, which is very significant because it's almost 8,000 more signatures
3. Don't allow any gifts or payments to the petitioners. They know it's almost impossible to collect a significant amount of signatures on free volunteer labor.
4. Right now if you can vote, you can be a petitioner. Basically 30 days residence in North Dakota. They want to up that to 120 days. This makes the pool shrink and they can look for loopholes to reject signature collectors.
5. Add a single subject rule. They know if it is approved, they can use one of their bought judges to rule on this. It's how they killed marijuana legalization in South Dakota and kept it off the ballot in Nebraska.

If you want to start a constitutional amendment, be sure you start it now.

I want to help those I grew up around and think that a program such as AA could do just that. The only problem I find is if you know anyone who had grown up and lived in the sticks, they usually have adapted to the lifestyle and have been left unchecked, leading to the normalization of day drinking, going to the bar every night and drinking till drunk, drunk driving and, (for those not afflicted) the presence of alcoholism and its negative effects. I understand that you can't help those who don't want it but if you don't even realize you have a problem and haven't had anything said about it to you, why would you think you need help or could have such a better existence by merely not drinking. Not to mention talking about feelings and emotions having weak or emasculate connotations to them.

&#x200B;

Last year October, my wife ended up having a stroke.  Medicaid will not cover her for recovery, which has been the entire year since now that she's been going through.  By cover, I mean they will not cover a longterm rehab stay at a facility, nor help with coverage for respite or a home care worker.  I am her only assistant, and have been taking care of her for a year now full time.  I quit my job up in Canada and receive some financial assistance from my family.

&#x200B;

My wife, unfortunately, has no family that can help her.  Both of her parents passed away a very long time ago (we're both in our early 30's, young age for her to have a stroke).  I am her only caretaker, and the only person that can help her.  I submitted paperwork to extend my stay here, and it seems like the USCIS is making it much harder for me to stay here for a prolonged stay to take care of my wife.  She's unable to use the bathroom on her own.  Feed herself, bathe herself and other day to day things she is unable to do.

&#x200B;

So I guess my question is, mostly out of desperation to not have to abandon my wife here, alone.  Is there any employment places here in Grand Forks specifically, that can help cover a worker visa, gain employment with said company, and have my wage garnished until the fee of the worker visa is covered, so I can stay here and continue to help my wife with her recovery.",2023-10-17 05:01:47

North Dakota,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",North Dakota senators boost their own meal reimbursements after rejecting free school lunch bill,"Thirteen Republican senators voted to increase meal reimbursements for state employees after voting against a bill to expand free school lunches for low-income students.

[https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-senators-boost-their-own-meal-reimbursements-after-rejecting-free-school-lunch-bill](https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-senators-boost-their-own-meal-reimbursements-after-rejecting-free-school-lunch-bill)

BISMARCK — Ten days after narrowly defeating a bill to provide free school lunches to low-income K-12 students, the North Dakota Senate approved legislation to increase the amount of money lawmakers and other state employees receive in meal reimbursements.

A leading Republican senator says employee meal compensation rates and free school lunch programs aren't related issues, but top Democrats see the chamber’s conflicting actions on the two bills as unjustifiable.

“I thought today’s vote was very self-serving,” said Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo. “How can we vote for ourselves when we can’t vote for children?”

The Republican-dominated Senate in late March rejected House Bill 1491 by a single vote. The legislation, which had previously passed the House, would have dedicated $6 million over the next two school years to cover lunch costs for K-12 students with family incomes below double the federal poverty level. Children from families of four making less than $60,000 a year would have qualified.

A federal program already provides free meals to students from families making below 130% of the federal poverty level, so the state allocation nixed by senators would have applied to kids with family incomes between 130-200% of the poverty level.

The Senate voted 26-21 on Thursday, April 6, to pass Senate Bill 2124, which would raise the meal reimbursements received by state employees during travel within North Dakota. Lawmakers attending interim legislative meetings are eligible for the payments, but they do not receive meal reimbursements during biennial sessions.

If Gov. Doug Burgum signs the bill, state employees could collect up to $45 a day to pay for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That’s a hike of nearly 29% on the current reimbursement rate of $35.

Thirteen Republican senators, including Majority Leader David Hogue and Assistant Majority Leader Jerry Klein, voted to increase meal reimbursements after voting against the free school lunch bill.

Hogue declined to comment on the reason he voted for Senate Bill 2124 and against House Bill 1491. He said North Dakota lawmakers often are asked to devote state funds to expand federal programs, like the National School Lunch Program or Medicaid.

“I don’t have a good answer for you as (to) why we do it sometimes and not others,” Hogue said.

Klein said he doesn’t think there’s “any correlation whatsoever” between the two bills, noting that lawmakers have to “treat each issue separately.”

State employees should get a higher per diem because inflation has made eating out much more expensive, he noted.

Klein said there is still money available and time left before lawmakers leave Bismarck to approve funding for school lunches. Last week, the House added the $6 million for free school lunches into a separate bill that has not yet returned to the Senate.

The other Republican senators who voted for Senate Bill 2124 and against House Bill 1491 are Randy Burckhard, David Clemens, Bob Erbele, Judy Estenson, Curt Kreun, Judy Lee, Randy Lemm, Larry Luick, Don Schaible, Terry Wanzek and Mike Wobbema.

Hogan said she was shocked and disappointed by Thursday’s vote. She dismissed Klein’s suggestion that the two bills are unrelated, noting that they would both spend taxpayer money to cover meals for North Dakotans.

The Senate’s inconsistent actions on the two bills will confuse the public and hurt the chamber’s credibility, Hogan said.

“There’s no underlying consistent philosophy to how we’re spending money in this session, and this is a classic example of it,” Hogan said.

Assistant House Minority Leader Zac Ista, a Grand Forks Democrat at the forefront of the push for free school lunches, said the Legislature should be looking to support both students and state employees.

“I think it shows (the Senate’s) priorities are a little out of whack when they have no problem increasing the meal reimbursement rate for ourselves but not for those families that may be struggling to make ends meet,” Ista said.",2023-04-07 01:08:20
North Dakota,BOTH,"Rainy day,like",Hiking guide for Teddy Roosevelt NP?,"After about a dozen or so emails to various businesses in the industry, and an online request through the park office itself, I have still only found one guide to hire within the park itself. I will likely book a day or two with Chasing Horses, but I can’t believe they’re the only guide for the whole national park. Nobody else that I’ve contacted seems to have a permit. I’ve asked the park office for a list of permit-holders but no reply yet.

I am traveling solo and looking for a few difficult day hikes, which is why I’d like to hire a guide. Likely early-mid Sept.

Any help would be appreciated.",2023-02-04 06:45:28

North Dakota,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried","Pissing on the will of the voters, 2.0","This will be on the ballot in 2024. Basically the legislature is pissed the voters dared to approve term limits. They are worried there may be something they don't like, like an abortion vote or a future marijuana legalization initiative. Basically they don't mind Statutory measures because they can simply gut them, like they did medical marijuana, so they need to make it virtually impossible.

They try to scare the public by comparing the state constitution with the US Constitution. It's not the same at all and the US Constitution overrides the state anyways. The State Constitution already has stupid shit in it.

Here's the plan. If this is approved by the ND voters in 2024....

1. A ballot measure would have to be approved twice, at both the June primary and November general election
2. Increase the percentage from 4% to 5%, which is very significant because it's almost 8,000 more signatures
3. Don't allow any gifts or payments to the petitioners. They know it's almost impossible to collect a significant amount of signatures on free volunteer labor.
4. Right now if you can vote, you can be a petitioner. Basically 30 days residence in North Dakota. They want to up that to 120 days. This makes the pool shrink and they can look for loopholes to reject signature collectors.
5. Add a single subject rule. They know if it is approved, they can use one of their bought judges to rule on this. It's how they killed marijuana legalization in South Dakota and kept it off the ballot in Nebraska.

If you want to start a constitutional amendment, be sure you start it now.

North Dakota,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",Defecting from Western ND!,"Hello fellow North Dakotans! I am here to tell you that in less than 2 weeks, I will be leaving my hometown of the very city where the Williston Bakken Oil Basin is located! Although I do not have anything to do with oil, I am considered to the entire state of ND as an “Oiler” because I’m from the oil parts of ND.

I will be defecting to the economic/retail/healthcare hub that is Fargo, ND. The Willistoners can keep their oil and live with it, I have been cheated by the Williston community as a result of the Bakken Oil Boom and it’s become clear to me that I am not needed in Williston.

To any Fargoans, Grand Forkers, Eastern North Dakotans and Northwestern Minnesotans, I am very excited and looking very forward to joining your community and I also look forward to seeking economic and social asylum in your most glorious region that you refer to as the Red River Valley or if this term exists: Minn-Kota! :)

Gone are the days of trusting the Mon-Dak communities and their oil and oppressive ways of turning down businesses and other stuff!

Starting Feb 1, 2024, goodbye hometown of Williston and hello Minn-Kota communities!

I will be sure to be a good loyal member and supporter of the Eastern ND/Northwest MN communities and their wonderful businesses, friendly people, and growing relationships with brand new friends and my future peers!

Don’t worry, I’ll be a good Eastern ND slave and obey the glorious commands of the glorious representatives of the great Minn-Kota Empire! :)

North Dakota,BOTH,"Rainy day,worried",How much would a retail worker wearing a kilt in Bismark need to worry about being accosted by transphobes mistaking him for a crossdresser?,"I work as a cart collector at my local lowe's, which means I do a lot of walking in a given day. Combine that with the fact that I'm a fatass with a 67 inch waistline (the very reason I got the job in the first place) and you get a shitload of friction between my thighs that's worn holes in the crotches of nearly all my pants over the two years I've had this job.

I figure that forking out the money for a kilt will be cheaper in the long run than a new pair of pants every month, but I also know the politics of this state all too well from the flags and stickers I see in the parking lot I work at every day. I've never really cared about what other people think of me, but I am worried about the handful of folks who're both ignorant and bigoted enough to outright assault me. I weigh 460lbs and carry a cane (it helps with the carts), so I feel I can probably hold my own against a lone assailant. But if they decide to gang up on me...",2023-03-24 23:05:40
North Dakota,BOTH,"Rainy day,Thrilled",ND GOP executive director resigns,"This article/news is a few weeks old at this point, but the crazy things our local officials have been saying lately this makes sense. 

It seems to me the GOP in North Dakota, and even the whole country, are splitting. ""The operations were being taken a completely different direction that was not clearly communicated with me many times, or I was intentionally being set up to take the fall for the NDGOP flaws, which makes it hard to function day to day. Executive Committee Members are acting as employees and not in an advisory capacity.""

It seems like the crazy MAGAs are actually taking over the party. I'm both thrilled and terrified about what might happen.",2023-10-05 14:34:42

To any Fargoans, Grand Forkers, Eastern North Dakotans and Northwestern Minnesotans, I am very excited and looking very forward to joining your community and I also look forward to seeking economic and social asylum in your most glorious region that you refer to as the Red River Valley or if this term exists: Minn-Kota! :)

Gone are the days of trusting the Mon-Dak communities and their oil and oppressive ways of turning down businesses and other stuff!

Starting Feb 1, 2024, goodbye hometown of Williston and hello Minn-Kota communities!

I will be sure to be a good loyal member and supporter of the Eastern ND/Northwest MN communities and their wonderful businesses, friendly people, and growing relationships with brand new friends and my future peers!

Don’t worry, I’ll be a good Eastern ND slave and obey the glorious commands of the glorious representatives of the great Minn-Kota Empire! :)

North Dakota,BOTH,"Freezing,like",Winter Funerals?,"Ok, hear me out.  

On another group, completely unrelated,  someone remarked that having a deceased person in the morgue or mortuary, refrigerated long term, was highly unlikely.  

Now, in situations like mass casualty events like Katrina, 9-11, even covid  - yes of course, it does happen.

I explained what I'd been told that here in ND, small town cemeteries don't dig graves during ""the freeze"" - because most small cemeteries still hand dig?  Also, it's not uncommon for a bunch of ""spring funerals"" for folks who died over winter (whether it's burying the body or cremated ashes).

One dude thinks I'm FoS.  But I've seen this several times in the 3 years we have lived in rural ND.

North Dakota,BOTH,"Cold snap,love","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

North Dakota,BOTH,"Cold snap,love",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

Second question is about finding places to rent. Like I said previously I can’t find any decent places to rent around the Williston area. I have looked on fb marketplace in the area to see if there were better options than Zillow and nothing. I’m not sure where else to look really and saw on another Reddit post response to ask the locals so I thought I would give it a shot asking on here and seeing if there were any other places I could look. For ppl that are curious yes I know it gets cold in ND and I am perfectly ok with that, as I get older it is harder to deal with the Texas heat and I really need a change of scenery.

North Dakota,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Best place for car mechanic jobs in North Dakota? ,"Hi, thinking of moving to North Dakota from Ireland. I’m looking for the best places in North Dakota to get employment as a mechanic. Experienced with both petrol (gas) & diesel. Cars, SUVs, vans, light trucks etc. never worked on HGVs just things up to 7.5 tons. Mostly worked on German & Japanese brands both in factories in Germany (and a short stint with the German employer in a plant in the US reworking production faults) and in main dealers in Ireland. Currently working mostly on light commercial vehicles (farm & construction SUVs & pickups, delivery vans, small delivery trucks) ideally where I’d be going should have reasonable pastureland within an hour because my wife is, well we don’t distinguish & call all Agri people farmers but in American terms you’d be talking homesteader/small rancher. Horses & beef so it doesn’t need to be dairy or cropping quality land. 

The reason we are considering this is to get away from our families & start fresh, we are mostly attracted by the low population & low cost of living but neither of us like the kind of heat you’d find in places like Texas. We don’t mind cold though. Proximity to the Canadian border is also a sell because it’s easier/cheaper to live ship horses into Canada & transport by road into America & she would like to bring some of her best breeding stock with her before selling out the rest at home. I know some people might wonder because we are looking at one of the whiter states but we aren’t racist so we don’t mind areas where a lot of people of other races live we are very accepting.

For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

North Dakota,BOTH,"Cold snap,like",Anyone from near grand forks?,"TLDR: lived in Florida my whole life, wanting to move to northern Minnesota, crookston Minnesota, which is apparently one of the the coldest habtial places on the planet, and I won’t have a car, I plan on only getting around by bike, walking, and the bus, if you know anything about winters around that area of crookston or grand forks ND, or a nearby area with similar winter conditions I would love to hear from ya if your willing to ☺️

My dream that I’ve been fantasizing about is moving to Minnesota if/when I get approved for SSI, 

I’ve in Florida All my life so I don’t know much about the cold and living in it, the place I’m wanting to move to is crookston, but unfortunately there’s very little info about it on the internet since it is such a small town and niche topic. It is evidently one of the coldest habitable places on the planet, , because it’s a cold area plus is very flat with very few trees to block any wind, so appearently gets down to like -60 windchill, and gets frequent blizzards, so I’ll be diving in the deep end 

I also don’t drive, and wouldn’t be able afford it even if I could, so I’ll be planning on relying only on foot, bike, and bus. I’ve been told by locals that it would be a very bad idea, and to not do it, it’d be near impossible to live there without a car. But I think with the right plan I can figure out a way to make it work.

So if anyone’s knollegable  about the what it’s like in the areas near the crookston and grand forks area and willing to help me brainstorm solutions I would appreciate the help immensely, 

my current worst case scenario plan is: “if it’s as bad in the winter as they say it is, and itd be impossible for me to get to the store for 4 month straight each winter”- then I’d stock up supplies each year during the warmer months then hybernating like a bear in my house, not leaving it for the 4 months that are too cold and windy to leave the house safely. I was also assured with about 90% certainty that Amazon does deliver to that area even during the winter, so ide be able to have access to that if I need anything during the hybernation months that I don’t have or run out of 

Ide be happy to to answer any question in the comments",2023-06-24 06:15:36

North Dakota,BOTH,"Cold snap,worried","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

&#x200B;

With the new design and colors, I have added a section that has a few useful links, such as the North Dakota DOT page, NDroads, and, thanks to the Canadian Government, a wildfire smoke forecast link (Its buggy on mobile). This is where I need your guys ***help and suggestions***, If there is anything important or worthy of being added in the 'Helpful Link"" box below, suggest below in the comments! If it's good, ill add it in!

**New** Reddit users and mobile users! You have noticed a design change as of the past week or so!  I hope all you are enjoying a refresh as 2/3rd of you use New Reddit vs Old Reddit, sorry Old Reddit the numbers are very low in usage! [https://i.imgur.com/6h3LBsv.png](https://i.imgur.com/6h3LBsv.png) .  I have no plans on ever touching the layout on old reddit again, just look at it as a time capsule!

With the new design and colors, I have added a section that has a few useful links, such as the North Dakota DOT page, NDroads, and, thanks to the Canadian Government, a wildfire smoke forecast link (Its buggy on mobile). This is where I need your guys ***help and suggestions***, If there is anything important or worthy of being added in the 'Helpful Link"" box below, suggest below in the comments!
