> Updated the **collect_redditPosts.py** by:
> * adding a identifier_keywords that include identifier for posts that include weather and the temperature.
> * making both a CSV and DB files just in case DB is more easier to work with

 If you use pycharm than install a plugin call **"SimpleSqliteBrowser"** which allow you to read the db file in a table format.
