1,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Visiting Florida in June?,"We are getting married in June and would love to honeymoon in Florida. However reading about it it seems like a rainy month and it makes me think it might not be the best time to visit? I have visited once in April (or February or March I can't remember, it was a family trip when I was a kid)  and then the weather was lovely.

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44+00:00

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

I feel like some people are caught up in making Florida ""theirs"", when in reality, Florida is for not just one. Florida is a piece of land that is extremely diverse in plants and animals. Florida is for observation only.

I think Florida should be protected from demolition. We should all protect Florida from the bleaching that some people are bringing. The plants and animals can't vote or talk, so we need to do it for them. Protect Florida!!!!!!!!!!!",2023-05-12 18:59:29+00:00

10,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

13,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36+00:00

16,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place.

My in laws and I along with wifey, we are coming to Miami this June, looking for advice from greats of Reddit of dos and don‚Äôt here. I have the Hollywood version of what to expect but we are looking to just have fun and explore nature along with good food. 

What should we see and what is not worth it? I know this is very subjective but we are nature loving people, don‚Äôt care for Disney world as don‚Äôt have too many days. 

We will be near the airport towards lauderhill mainly. Thinking of going to the glades and southern mainly. But open to suggestions. 
Please help 

Any advice is much appreciated

36,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love","What are some fun, outdoor, adventurous things to do in Florida?","Throwaway account.  


So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.   


Thanks in advance!",2023-01-06 16:52:31+00:00
37,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

40,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! üëã We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

60,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.

73,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

76,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"".

Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

92,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Things have definitely changed a lot since the Pre-Desantis days, and especially following the devastation from Hurricane Ian, but is it really *that* bad? Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid. I've considered moving back at some point for the Tropical Weather and beaches, possibly around Broward County or elsewhere in SEFL which is fairly liberal, and I'm also wondering how things have changed there.

94,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

155,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
156,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

160,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

194,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.

200,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon.

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

220,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

One of my concerns is that I've heard mixed things about Florida apparently being racist I'm a black man and the things I've heard make me want to reconsider. For those of you who have been there most of your life what is your experience is it racist there? I should also mention that I'm in a relationship with my 2 girlfriends that would be moving there with me one of them is trans and I've also heard that it can be very close minded there.

I sat outside both nights with a nice fire and was able to sit on the bare ground because there are absolutely  NO bugs! 

This is the magical two months (Jan-Feb) that those of us who live in the northern part of Florida get to experience a little change of season but nothing too harsh. I love the winter months in north central Florida. It‚Äôs just cold enough to give us some exhilarating nights, but not cold enough to turn our landscape into a brown, barren hellscape.

Requirements are: White powdery beaches. Great food and shopping options all in walking distance. I will have a rental car regardless.

239,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Young Canadian Engineer wanting to move to Florida - Give me your advice!,"Hey! I'll provide as much information about myself as I can so you guys can give me the right advice.

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship. 

My questions to you are:

1. What are the biggest cons that I might face for a person in my position?
2. What city/region would you recommend for me to move to?
3. Do you think there's another state that would better suit me?",2023-04-24 22:05:38+00:00

242,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23+00:00

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

256,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

257,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

265,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest.

We are flying to Miami in mid February and just want to have a relaxing time with a 7 year old child and see the southern part of Florida (everglades, keys, miami, jupiter) and if weather permits swim in the ocean and spend time on the beach. We have 11 days total, but I can't pick a city to rent an airbnb in and which to use as a hub. I booked a condo with a pool in Aventura, but I'm reading about the traffic and the fact that there's no ocean access and I'm already hesitant if it‚Äôs a good choice.. I didn't want to stay in Miami itself because it's a noisy and pricy  but now I'm not ruling it out.

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter

298,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
299,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

301,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

I‚Äôve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

310,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.

317,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

337,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

341,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! üëã We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

357,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

I (22M) stayed in the beautiful city of Melbourne last year for 3 months for a summer engineering internship, and by the end, I wanted to move there

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do?

372,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

373,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

384,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do?

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

418,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
419,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

421,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

435,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36+00:00

438,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

I live in central Florida, where there's obviously a lot of hot sunny days. But I also live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of trees, my property has 11 in or around it. At all times at least a 1/3 of my house is under tree shade. My house is gabled if that is relevant, but the common area is vaulted.

I am having my house reroofed in two months. When I had the guy out for a quote I asked him if he had light coloured or cool roof options. He said yes, they use Owens Corning and these have reflective granules that help though he was very insistent to let me know they are not actually energy star. He said they used to be but no longer have that, so not sure if they changed the shingles or if the requirements for getting that changed and they just lost the certificate. I digress, He insisted that the colour I chose wouldn't effect it as much as I think, especially because he noted the ventilation currently is just two vents, and they will be adding shingle over ridge vents. He also suggested dark because of the trees, insisting that the lighter colours will look gross and moldy which is definitely true as my drip edge is white now and they look terrible no matter how often I clean them.

My issue is I don't want to chose aesthetic over energy efficiency. 1/3 of the house is vaulted so there is no attic space above. And even if these Owen Corning Duration have this reflective granules and we add much more ventilation, will that be enough to keep my energy from going up? I don't think the roof guy is lying, I'm just concerned he doesn't actually know cause his job is to sell roofs, not know what happens after that.

TLDR, I have a lot of trees and live in central Florida. Roofer insisted with the Owen Corning Duration, colour doesn't matter much and he recommended black roof so it doesn't look dirty from tree debris. I'm concerned my energy bill will go up but he insists it won't cause they will be adding more ventilation. I have never seen a black roof here and I feel like there's a reason why.

  
Edit: just to clarify, the roof guy recommended the black or gray shingles, but it is ultimately my choice. he was not trying to push them onto me if it's coming across that way. I made a mockup and LOVED the black shingles.",2024-05-26 15:16:06+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

459,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

463,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! üëã We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

472,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

481,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

495,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

496,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here.

Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that‚Äôs how it works.

Don‚Äôt have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That‚Äôs petty, makes you look childish.

499,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, hate",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

503,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

506,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec.

I lived in the Fort Myers area for a little while and really enjoyed it before moving back to Maryland where I've lived since. Things have definitely changed a lot since the Pre-Desantis days, and especially following the devastation from Hurricane Ian, but is it really *that* bad? Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid. I've considered moving back at some point for the Tropical Weather and beaches, possibly around Broward County or elsewhere in SEFL which is fairly liberal, and I'm also wondering how things have changed there.

508,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

The couple tell the Officer, ""there's no problem here"", ""we're good"", as soon as our Uber gets here, we're leaving"".

The Officer insists that by law, if he sees anyone makes contact with another, whether charges are pressed or not, as an Officer,  he must arrest. The Officer will even add that if an arrest is not made, he the Officer will get in trouble. ""I'm just doing my job"".

And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do?

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

The heron‚Äôs height and beautiful blue-gray plumage are hard to miss. They can reach 54 inches from head to tail, have a wingspan up to 75 inches, but weigh a mere 5-6 pounds.

You will most often find a Great Blue Heron standing alone at the water‚Äôs edge in saltwater or freshwater habitats. Fish, turtles, frogs, insects, birds, and rodents that pass within the area of the heron‚Äôs long neck are quickly snatched up by its powerful, long beak. Herons will also forage in fields or grasslands for frogs, birds, and small rodents.

During the breeding season, Great Blue Herons and their mates become part of a breeding colony that can include hundreds of pairs. Breeding colonies of Great Blue Herons are most often found in trees that are within 2-4 miles of their feeding areas. They may also be seen in mangroves, bushes, or on the ground. Males court females who lay 2-6 eggs. The couple shares the responsibility of incubating the eggs for up to a month and feeding the hatchlings for up to 3 months.

While Great Blue Heron‚Äôs remain mostly monogamous and enjoy the protection of the colony during the breeding season, for the rest of the year, they are solitary birds and will aggressively defend their feeding territory.

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background?

The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly.

Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/s/zPy0XbmLln

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00
545,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, happy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

547,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
548,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

550,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

I'm from Texas and I totally get the misconceptions that certain states get but I was blown away in Florida. 

I spent a month in FTL then a week in Sarasota and night in Tallahassee. I'd love to spend more time in Tampa and Tallahassee! Tampa seems like a chiller/smaller Dallas on the ocean, with slightly more culture lol. Tallahassee is so incredibly beautiful with all the greenery and live oaks! 

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on... 

Overall I was impressed with people! Everyone was so nice and chill! The drivers are insane (as they are in Dallas) but I found people were so much more genuinely nice than anticipated. (I blame Miami for the bad rap). 

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating. 

Side note: your summers are a notch down compared to Texas. Yes its hot. Yes it's humid. But at least yall get regular days of clouds or thunderstorms. That's exceedingly rare in Texas. you can't skimp on that sunscreen or hat though! The sun is no joke.

569,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences?

576,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day.

My other options are Northern Virginia, DC, PA, NJ. 

I was looking through the sub and instead of asking about pros and cons, tell me why you‚Äôre leaving. I‚Äôd love to hear from those of you who moved from the Northeast and are leaving the state.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

596,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

600,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! üëã We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

611,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23+00:00

No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

635,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

636,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

652,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.

I've vacationed in Florida many times throughout my life, all over the state really. However, each vacation has been in the late spring or middle summer. We're looking at places anywhere from 30A to Marco Island - prefer to stay on the Gulf side.

My question is mainly about the weather... Which area will have the most reliable weather for mid-November, and will also have reasonable prices for stay and activities?

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

1. What are the biggest cons that I might face for a person in my position?
2. What city/region would you recommend for me to move to?

684,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.
 
I‚Äôm curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32+00:00

710,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
711,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

713,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

I feel like we are not taking care of Florida. We are changing it into something unenjoyable. I feel like some people are caught up in making Florida ""theirs"", when in reality, Florida is for not just one. Florida is a piece of land that is extremely diverse in plants and animals.

743,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36+00:00

749,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

773,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! üëã We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

790,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

I am considering the south of Georgia or north of Florida like Jacksonville, Gainesville, Ocala and may be Orlando too. We are not big fan of beach so definitely not considering any coastal areas.

We are in early 40s and considering buying a land (may be 2-4 ac lot) and get it constructed and use most of the portion in gardening and growing our own food.

Generally 2ac or more lots are available in outskirts of these cities. we like more of the rural communities and we might be Ok with this. Do we need to worry about security concerns in outskirts?

I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

804,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

805,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y‚Äôall‚Äôs lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I‚Äôd kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don‚Äôt like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that‚Äôs how it works.

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

813,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec.

I lived in the Fort Myers area for a little while and really enjoyed it before moving back to Maryland where I've lived since. Things have definitely changed a lot since the Pre-Desantis days, and especially following the devastation from Hurricane Ian, but is it really *that* bad? Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid. I've considered moving back at some point for the Tropical Weather and beaches, possibly around Broward County or elsewhere in SEFL which is fairly liberal, and I'm also wondering how things have changed there.

815,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

846,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
847,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

849,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

858,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

884,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

906,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

920,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

921,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

929,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

I've vacationed in Florida many times throughout my life, all over the state really. However, each vacation has been in the late spring or middle summer. We're looking at places anywhere from 30A to Marco Island - prefer to stay on the Gulf side.

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

962,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
963,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

965,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

I‚Äôm 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can‚Äôt do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there‚Äôs sometimes no sidewalk. And I‚Äôve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don‚Äôt have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again. I have a car again, and seriously it takes zero effort to let a bicycle cross the fucking street or give them some space. What is wrong with our country?

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

975,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.

981,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day.

1000,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love","What are some fun, outdoor, adventurous things to do in Florida?","Throwaway account.  


So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.   


Thanks in advance!",2023-01-06 16:52:31+00:00
1001,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

1023,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

1037,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1038,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

1048,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

1079,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
1080,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

1082,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

1098,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

1111,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love","Roofer says black shingles won't effect electric cost in Florida, looking for advice from other professionals!","Hello! I could use some advice, especially if you are a roofing contractor or work in energy auditing but all are welcome.

I live in central Florida, where there's obviously a lot of hot sunny days. But I also live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of trees, my property has 11 in or around it. At all times at least a 1/3 of my house is under tree shade. My house is gabled if that is relevant, but the common area is vaulted.

I am having my house reroofed in two months. When I had the guy out for a quote I asked him if he had light coloured or cool roof options. He said yes, they use Owens Corning and these have reflective granules that help though he was very insistent to let me know they are not actually energy star. He said they used to be but no longer have that, so not sure if they changed the shingles or if the requirements for getting that changed and they just lost the certificate. I digress, He insisted that the colour I chose wouldn't effect it as much as I think, especially because he noted the ventilation currently is just two vents, and they will be adding shingle over ridge vents. He also suggested dark because of the trees, insisting that the lighter colours will look gross and moldy which is definitely true as my drip edge is white now and they look terrible no matter how often I clean them.

My issue is I don't want to chose aesthetic over energy efficiency. 1/3 of the house is vaulted so there is no attic space above. And even if these Owen Corning Duration have this reflective granules and we add much more ventilation, will that be enough to keep my energy from going up? I don't think the roof guy is lying, I'm just concerned he doesn't actually know cause his job is to sell roofs, not know what happens after that.

TLDR, I have a lot of trees and live in central Florida. Roofer insisted with the Owen Corning Duration, colour doesn't matter much and he recommended black roof so it doesn't look dirty from tree debris. I'm concerned my energy bill will go up but he insists it won't cause they will be adding more ventilation. I have never seen a black roof here and I feel like there's a reason why.

  
Edit: just to clarify, the roof guy recommended the black or gray shingles, but it is ultimately my choice. he was not trying to push them onto me if it's coming across that way. I made a mockup and LOVED the black shingles.",2024-05-26 15:16:06+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day.

1121,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

However reading about it it seems like a rainy month and it makes me think it might not be the best time to visit? I have visited once in April (or February or March I can't remember, it was a family trip when I was a kid)  and then the weather was lovely.

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44+00:00

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

1141,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1157,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here.

Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

1169,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background?

The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly.

Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone‚Äôs photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00
1210,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, happy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

1212,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
1213,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

1215,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea.

Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February?

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I could use some advice, especially if you are a roofing contractor or work in energy auditing but all are welcome.

I live in central Florida, where there's obviously a lot of hot sunny days. But I also live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of trees, my property has 11 in or around it. At all times at least a 1/3 of my house is under tree shade. My house is gabled if that is relevant, but the common area is vaulted.

I am having my house reroofed in two months. When I had the guy out for a quote I asked him if he had light coloured or cool roof options. He said yes, they use Owens Corning and these have reflective granules that help though he was very insistent to let me know they are not actually energy star. He said they used to be but no longer have that, so not sure if they changed the shingles or if the requirements for getting that changed and they just lost the certificate. I digress, He insisted that the colour I chose wouldn't effect it as much as I think, especially because he noted the ventilation currently is just two vents, and they will be adding shingle over ridge vents. He also suggested dark because of the trees, insisting that the lighter colours will look gross and moldy which is definitely true as my drip edge is white now and they look terrible no matter how often I clean them.

My issue is I don't want to chose aesthetic over energy efficiency. 1/3 of the house is vaulted so there is no attic space above. And even if these Owen Corning Duration have this reflective granules and we add much more ventilation, will that be enough to keep my energy from going up? I don't think the roof guy is lying, I'm just concerned he doesn't actually know cause his job is to sell roofs, not know what happens after that.

TLDR, I have a lot of trees and live in central Florida. Roofer insisted with the Owen Corning Duration, colour doesn't matter much and he recommended black roof so it doesn't look dirty from tree debris. I'm concerned my energy bill will go up but he insists it won't cause they will be adding more ventilation. I have never seen a black roof here and I feel like there's a reason why.

  
Edit: just to clarify, the roof guy recommended the black or gray shingles, but it is ultimately my choice. he was not trying to push them onto me if it's coming across that way. I made a mockup and LOVED the black shingles.",2024-05-26 15:16:06+00:00

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

1320,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, enjoy",Great Blue Heron,"Great Blue Herons, Ardea herodias, are one of the most recognizable birds in Florida. The heron‚Äôs height and beautiful blue-gray plumage are hard to miss. They can reach 54 inches from head to tail, have a wingspan up to 75 inches, but weigh a mere 5-6 pounds.

You will most often find a Great Blue Heron standing alone at the water‚Äôs edge in saltwater or freshwater habitats. Fish, turtles, frogs, insects, birds, and rodents that pass within the area of the heron‚Äôs long neck are quickly snatched up by its powerful, long beak. Herons will also forage in fields or grasslands for frogs, birds, and small rodents.

During the breeding season, Great Blue Herons and their mates become part of a breeding colony that can include hundreds of pairs. Breeding colonies of Great Blue Herons are most often found in trees that are within 2-4 miles of their feeding areas. They may also be seen in mangroves, bushes, or on the ground. Males court females who lay 2-6 eggs. The couple shares the responsibility of incubating the eggs for up to a month and feeding the hatchlings for up to 3 months.

While Great Blue Heron‚Äôs remain mostly monogamous and enjoy the protection of the colony during the breeding season, for the rest of the year, they are solitary birds and will aggressively defend their feeding territory.

1324,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn‚Äôt an option financially, or logistically, or because you‚Äôre a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic. Florida welcomes your soon-to-be Republic children.",2023-06-19 16:26:55+00:00

I'm from Texas and I totally get the misconceptions that certain states get but I was blown away in Florida. 

I spent a month in FTL then a week in Sarasota and night in Tallahassee. I'd love to spend more time in Tampa and Tallahassee! Tampa seems like a chiller/smaller Dallas on the ocean, with slightly more culture lol. Tallahassee is so incredibly beautiful with all the greenery and live oaks! 

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on... 

Overall I was impressed with people! Everyone was so nice and chill! The drivers are insane (as they are in Dallas) but I found people were so much more genuinely nice than anticipated. (I blame Miami for the bad rap). 

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating. 

Side note: your summers are a notch down compared to Texas. Yes its hot. Yes it's humid. But at least yall get regular days of clouds or thunderstorms. That's exceedingly rare in Texas. you can't skimp on that sunscreen or hat though! The sun is no joke.

1333,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, clouds, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country.

Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them?

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I could use some advice, especially if you are a roofing contractor or work in energy auditing but all are welcome.

I live in central Florida, where there's obviously a lot of hot sunny days. But I also live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of trees, my property has 11 in or around it. At all times at least a 1/3 of my house is under tree shade. My house is gabled if that is relevant, but the common area is vaulted.

I am having my house reroofed in two months. When I had the guy out for a quote I asked him if he had light coloured or cool roof options. He said yes, they use Owens Corning and these have reflective granules that help though he was very insistent to let me know they are not actually energy star. He said they used to be but no longer have that, so not sure if they changed the shingles or if the requirements for getting that changed and they just lost the certificate. I digress, He insisted that the colour I chose wouldn't effect it as much as I think, especially because he noted the ventilation currently is just two vents, and they will be adding shingle over ridge vents. He also suggested dark because of the trees, insisting that the lighter colours will look gross and moldy which is definitely true as my drip edge is white now and they look terrible no matter how often I clean them.

My issue is I don't want to chose aesthetic over energy efficiency. 1/3 of the house is vaulted so there is no attic space above. And even if these Owen Corning Duration have this reflective granules and we add much more ventilation, will that be enough to keep my energy from going up? I don't think the roof guy is lying, I'm just concerned he doesn't actually know cause his job is to sell roofs, not know what happens after that.

TLDR, I have a lot of trees and live in central Florida. Roofer insisted with the Owen Corning Duration, colour doesn't matter much and he recommended black roof so it doesn't look dirty from tree debris. I'm concerned my energy bill will go up but he insists it won't cause they will be adding more ventilation. I have never seen a black roof here and I feel like there's a reason why.

  
Edit: just to clarify, the roof guy recommended the black or gray shingles, but it is ultimately my choice. he was not trying to push them onto me if it's coming across that way. I made a mockup and LOVED the black shingles.",2024-05-26 15:16:06+00:00

I'm from Nashville, TN but remember finding them through other bands pages and loved their music. The band was from Venice, Florida according to their Myspace that is still up: [https://myspace.com/theawarenesscommittee](https://myspace.com/theawarenesscommittee) I remember messaging them to come up here on a tour.

When Myspace was on the outs around 2010 I started downloading as much music from small local bands that I listened to at the time so that I'd still be able to listen to it. Over the multiple ownership changes of the site, they managed to lose pretty much all of the data from the old platform. Pictures, videos and sadly music.

I managed to download the EP that The Awareness Committee had on their page, but the program I used had a bug and only downloaded short snippets of the files. So I still have this album (in partial format) and listen to it often.

So I'm taking a shot in the dark to see if anyone is familiar with that band or the people in it. I'd love to get in touch and get a full version of that album if it's still out there by some miracle.",2024-02-02 07:05:53+00:00

I've lived in Florida my whole life, but have only actually camped out here once or twice.

So, I'm looking for recommendations and opinions. A couple of notes:

1.) My wife and I love the outdoors and are vigorous people, but she is currently pregnant, so while hiking/swimming/canoeing isn't an issue, anything more intense (horseback riding, diving, rapids) is out of the question.

2.)  Proximity to Tampa is preferred.

3.) We both enjoy swimming with manatees, is there a best park where we can have that experience + camp?

4.) I'm considering the Kissimmee Prairie Preserve, especially because of its' Dark Sky designation and the possibility to do some star-gazing. However, it is kind of a distance away and the park at face-value doesn't seem to offer much more. Can anyone attest if:

a.) Is the park worth the visit in general?

and

b.) Are the star-gazing opportunities significantly better at Kissimmee State Park than other parks in Florida?

1460,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, love",I need advice on spending the winter season in Florida.,"I'm a personal trainer and I currently live on the east end of long island.  
I work in a phisical therapist office, at the school gym, a private gym, and in home private sessions. I also work for the town recreation department and I instruct a fitness class that I have created. I write for the news paper here as well. I have many certifications in fitness and nutrition. I have been a master trainer for a few years. I started training in 08.

Living here on the east end in the Hamptons is nice. Iv been here most of my life. But the winter season is absolutely devastating. It gets freezing cold for 8 months out of the year. It gets dark at like 3:30 sometimes in the hart of winter. It's lonely, sad and empty. It's awful! Every year I look forward to summer.. and then when the fall comes its very depressing. This past summer has been very chilly and rainy, it's like sumer hasn't even happened. And  ow its getting dark very earlyand cold every morning.. all the plants are dying and and the season is changing. 

If I could spend some time in a warmer climate during the winter!  Omg what a dream come true.. even if it's just a month or two to start. I went to Miami for the weekend last year and loved it there. The energy, the fitness community, the sun and the beach! People everywhere! I was in love! 

So I need advice, or connections or something. I don't know anyone there and don't know my way around.. I know Florida is a big state but I resonate with the southern part I think.  I reached out to a few gyms and they saw my resume and asked me to come in right away for an interview.. only thing is I'm on long Island.  Also as a trainer most of my income comes from private sessions in-home anyway. 

Oh.. living here in the Hamptons I'm able to generate alot of income. However outgo is the same.. meaning my savings isn't exactly ideal. 
So I'd be looking for something affordable. And I wouldn't be able to find a summer rental when I come back. Ill have to keep my lease intact. I pay both rent bills..",2023-08-30 13:23:06+00:00

1471,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

How reliable will Hawaii's electrical system be if we encounter periods of bad weather.     The 40 days of rain was once a Century probably - but having 5-7 days of stormy weather with very low UV is not that rare.

Yesterday we had our second largest combustion electric plant lose 2 of 6 generators.    So we lost about 10-12% of our total combustion generation on Oahu and ONE DAY of bad weather (west side hit hard all morning but east side still had sun until 2pm) - and our Entire Island Gets Rolling Blackouts!

Rough numbers are 1400-1600mw combustion on Oahu and that plant was about 500mw and 33% went down (assuming all 6 are normally running for the 500mw).   Top of my head after looking last night.  

Our system is that fragile that 10-12% can take down our entire island!   

Is Oahu going to keep backup combustion anywhere near low UV days elec demand?    I doubt it.

We are an island - we cant just take electric from another state when its cloudy.

Lawmakers are passing these retarded bills and when projects arent ready they still plow ahead regardless of what happens - like shutting down the clean coal plant and raising our rates 25% immediately.   Solar farms and battery storage wasnt ready.   

That power plant was producing up to 20% of our Electric needs.    Last night would not have happened.    It also produced electricity at $0.11 per khw.    That should have stayed open until solar and storage was ready.

Has there ever been any local government push for more bike lanes, etc? And what I mean by that is commuting. I‚Äôve lived in Waikiki for almost two years now and I feel like real bike lanes on every street in Waikiki would change lives significantly. I work at Pearl Harbor and the weather here is so incredible I‚Äôd be more than willing to get my car off the road and commute 18 miles round trip 5x a week, but it‚Äôs near impossible because of how dangerous and congested the roads are. I love the biki system, but I feel like I‚Äôm going to die every time I ride one.

The 40 days of rain was once a Century probably - but having 5-7 days of stormy weather with very low UV is not that rare.

Yesterday we had our second largest combustion electric plant lose 2 of 6 generators.    So we lost about 10-12% of our total combustion generation on Oahu and ONE DAY of bad weather (west side hit hard all morning but east side still had sun until 2pm) - and our Entire Island Gets Rolling Blackouts!

Rough numbers are 1400-1600mw combustion on Oahu and that plant was about 500mw and 33% went down (assuming all 6 are normally running for the 500mw).   Top of my head after looking last night.  

Our system is that fragile that 10-12% can take down our entire island!   

Is Oahu going to keep backup combustion anywhere near low UV days elec demand?    I doubt it.

We are an island - we cant just take electric from another state when its cloudy.

Lawmakers are passing these retarded bills and when projects arent ready they still plow ahead regardless of what happens - like shutting down the clean coal plant and raising our rates 25% immediately.   Solar farms and battery storage wasnt ready.   

That power plant was producing up to 20% of our Electric needs.    Last night would not have happened.    It also produced electricity at $0.11 per khw.    That should have stayed open until solar and storage was ready.

1581,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love","""Dangerous"" Areas of Oahu: A Guest's Perspective","Aloha.

I have lived on Oahu for 12 years. I came here when I was 20.

People who come here always inevitably ask if there are areas to avoid. Well...maybe not always, because a lot of people think Hawaii is one big beach town and don't know that life happens here too. 

Anyway, having spent a lot of time in three of the areas considered most ""dangerous"" on Oahu, here are my impressions of Ewa Beach, Waipahu, and Waianae. (Pls excuse formatting, I'm on mobile)

1. Ewa Beach

The real Ewa Beach. Hanakahi Street, Hau Bush, Papipi Road, Silva's, etc. Because a lot of people say ""Ewa Beach"" when they mean Ocean Pointe or Ewa Gentry. I've heard stories that back before the Gentry-fication of the area, Ewa Beach was rough. I have a good friend who, back in the 90s, had just moved to Hawaii and was set to go to Campbell. Apparently, a security guard at the school told his mom she might want to rethink that decision, as a nerdy Haole boy might not fare well at that particular school. That friend ended up going to Radford.

Today, while Ewa Beach definitely still has a reputation, I get the feeling that it has calmed down a lot. I think this is due to the expansion of greater Ewa and the influx of so many new people. Back then, Ewa Beach was isolated. It was the end of the road. Nowadays, it is a neighborhood in a much larger population center.

Ewa Beach certainly feels different from greater Ewa. It's a lot older, more local, and more ""neighborhoody."" It has an identity that one immediately recognizes as Ewa Beach after living here for a certain amount of time. And you can always recognize an Ewa Beach guy. I don't know how, but you can. And if you can't recognize it, you'll know it in time, because Ewa Beach people always let you know they're from Ewa Beach. 

There are still stories about robberies, fights, and other unfortunate events that one hears coming out of Ewa Beach, but I would absolutely not consider it a very ""dangerous"" area. Rough? Sure, in some places. There were just some robberies and assaults down there. But I've never felt in grave danger being down there. Just cautious about my surroundings. 

Ewa Beach is definitely an interesting place. It's a perfect encapsulation of the tension Oahu feels between the old and the new. It's a town with an old reputation for lawlessness that has lost much of its grit because of rapid Gentry-fication. 

You know those old guys who you know were badass fighters in their youths? The guys who have grown overweight, are gray-haired, and who like to regale you with crazy stories from 30 years ago? They aren't as fearsome as they once were, but you still wouldn't want to be on their bad side and so you respect them. That, to me, is Ewa Beach.

2. Waipahu 

Go to Don Quijote and count how many languages you hear. English. Filipino. Ilocano. Marshallese. Samoan. Chuukese. Filipino. Ilocano. Filipino. Welcome to Waipahu. 94 Block.

For those who don't know, Waipahu is an old mill town that used to process a lot of sugar cane. It's not a beach town like Ewa Beach or Waianae. It's like a suburb of a suburb of Town (""Honolulu""). I mean suburb not in the sense of Suburbia, but in the sense of a town somewhat in the orbit of a larger city. I used to hate going there because it felt so congested, and then they started building the rail and I hated it even more.

Now, however, after having worked there for about a year, I love Waipahu. Old Waipahu town, from about Kunia road all the way to Waipahu High School. Yes, I know, Kunia, Waipio, and Waikele exist, but I mean Waipahu Waipahu.

It's gritty. It's historic. It can certainly be sketchy, and it's even menacing in places. I had a friend who lived on Pupuole Street, and he told me many stories about the nighttime activities in the neighborhood. Every time I went to visit him there, my head was on a swivel. 

Then there's Aniani. Oh man. It's such a small neighborhood, really just a street, but it has a reputation for being pretty hectic. I've never hung out there, but I've taken rides down there and it's pretty wild. Casual fire starting, trash everywhere, sneakers hanging from power lines, addicts pushing shopping wagons full of ""found"" goods, etc.

My boss was born and raised in Waipahu, and when I asked her about Aniani, she told me it's always been Aniani. I even heard nobody used to deliver food there because it was too dangerous. That said, I think part of this was probably due to how tight that street is and how you have to turn around at the end to get out. 

Waipahu transit station? Sweet old Filipina tutus and zombies. Times shoppers. People just passing through to get their TB shots at the Civic Center. Others passed out on the bus stop benches.

Waipahu is frequently in the news for robberies, break-ins, and other unpleasant happenings. There are a lot of homeless, many of whom are, unfortunately, addicted to drugs. I worked in a medical office in the area and we had many incidents with public disturbances, including public nudity, public masturbation, and other such quirky occurrences. 

That said, there is a beauty to Waipahu. I love its diversity. It is a kind of entry point for many new Hawaii residents, especially from the Philippines, but also from Samoa, the Marshall Islands, Chuuk, etc. Mom and Pop shops, restaurants, barber shops, medical offices, and all manner of businesses line Farrington Highway. Waipahu feels unique among other Oahu towns because of its ethnic composition. These cultures give Waipahu a different kind of flavor than places like Waianae or Kapolei. The only other place I imagine has a similar vibe is Kalihi, but I haven't spent much time there. 

Waipahu is very dense, as it is an immigrant town with multiple generations often living in the same small apartments. Familial living is the norm in Hawaii, but in Waipahu this is even more prevalent. It's not just parents, grandparents, and children -- it's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, cousins, uncles, and aunties. 

Is Waipahu dangerous? It certainly feels more gritty than Ewa Beach, and one certainly should take certain precautions in certain parts of the town. It's like...you're unlikely to be shot at, but there are places there where you wouldn't necessarily be surprised to see people with guns. I guess it can be dangerous, but I feel like if you know the town and how to navigate it, you'll be fine. Waipahu is certainly not Detroit, but it ain't Mililani either (Mililani seems to be becoming more like Waipahu though from what I've been seeing in the news). Overall, Waipahu is one of my favorite places on the island.

(Take a shot for every time I write the word ""certainly"")

3. Waianae

This is the one you've been waiting on. The West Side. 96792. The Waianae Coast. If you're scared, just stay in Kapolei. 

For convenience, I will refer to the whole Coast as Waianae. In reality, there are differences between Nanakuli, Maili, Waianae, and Makaha. A quick impression: 

- Nanakuli feels very Hawaiian. The whole Coast is very Hawaiian, but Nanakuli in particular feels very Hawaiian. 

- Maili feels like...I don't know, a kind of middle ground? Sea Country (a newer housing development, for those not in the know) is there, but it's tucked away in the back. Almost the exact opposite of Ewa Beach, where the new part is in the front. I'd say Maili feels very residential.

- Waianae proper is the heart of Oahu's Wild West. Lots of stores, food places, and other businesses.

- Makaha is country. Not a lot of stuff to buy, but a lot to explore. Far less dense than the other three towns.

But let's proceed with the conversation. 

This is the area most people who aren't from Hawaii first hear about when they ask what the most dangerous part of the island is or where to stay away from. Sure, they'll hear about Kalihi. They'll hear about Wahiawa and Waipahu. But Waianae is different.

Waianae is isolated. One way in, one way out. It's far removed from the sprawl that starts in Kapolei and ends roughly somewhere after Hawaii Kai. It's closed off. This isolation is a kind of double-edged sword: on the one hand, it ensures that Waianae stays Waianae, but on the other hand, it concentrates a lot of the darker aspects of Waianae to that region. 

I was once one of those new Hawaii residents, but my knowledge of Waianae was gained from Google prior to moving to Hawaii. When I arrived in Kapolei, a family member living here took me to Waianae shortly after my arrival. I was shocked. I saw homeless tents all along the road. I saw liquor stores and big lifted trucks. I smelled weed literally everywhere. I saw lots of cops in certain parts. I saw a population that looked different from the people I had just seen in Kapolei. 

12 years later, I still see all of that, but I see Waianae for what it truly is: a community. 

The thing about Waianae is that it's not just local, it's Hawaiian (but with a whole lotta Portuguese last names). This makes it different than somewhere like, say, Pearl City or Nuuanu. Those places have plenty of locals, but ethnically speaking, these areas are more Filipino and/or Japanese. 

Waianae, on the other hand, has the highest concentration of Kanaka Maoli on Oahu, which means that local culture there is dominated by Hawaiian culture. This is where you find Hawaiian immersion schools, Hawaiian murals, and so forth. There are non-Hawaiians who live in Waianae, but the historical structure of the community is rooted in old Hawaiian culture. 

I used to work at the Comp (if you know, you know). And it was at the Comp where I first learned just how strong of a community Waianae was. My co-workers would call older Patients uncle and aunty, which is obviously the norm in Hawaii, but they would actually be related to the Patients. Like, ""oh yeah that's my mom's cousin"" or ""that's my dad's older brother."" Everybody seemed to know each other from school, family ties, or some other connection. It was incredible. 

After work, I'd drive home back to Kapolei, and everyone was outside. Everyone was at the beach (shout out to Nanakuli Beach Park), at the parks, taking walks, etc. And as soon as I got back to Kapolei, with its shopping centers and carefully-manicured streets, I felt like I had left something behind in Waianae.

Waianae is rough. I hesitate to use the term ""ghetto,"" because I don't think it's quite ""ghetto."" It's more of a working-class country kind of vibe. It's more rural Mississippi Delta than Southside Chicago. But make no mistake, whatever you call it, Waianae is a rough area. Drugs are everywhere, shootings are not uncommon (I started writing this shortly after the chicken fight shooting and there was just another shooting at Makaha Beach) and scrapping is a beloved pastime. 

It's sad to see the social issues that plague Waianae, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done in that community. But the beautiful thing is that the work is being done by the community. That's the thing about Waianae: nobody there is content with just waiting for the State to help out. Waianae takes matters into its own hands. 

The State won't provide affordable housing for the house houseless? Waianae builds a houseless community.

Healthcare hard to come by in Waianae? Waianae builds a medical center.

Hawaiian language in danger of dying out among the younger generations? Waianae builds Hawaiian language immersion schools. 

They say Waianae is ghetto, but I say it's proud. It's not somewhere the average tourist or newcomer to Oahu is likely to understand, so many may go once and not go back or avoid it altogether. Waianae's reputation is part of the reason it has managed to retain a certain vibe that other parts of Oahu have lost.

Is it dangerous? I hate this question. Waianae is not Rio de Janeiro, but if someone visiting from Iowa were to ask me, I'd tell them that you definitely need to understand that it's not the Hawaii they promote to tourists in the brochures. Someone from the Bronx might not consider it dangerous because there aren't swaths of gangbangers shooting at each other, but they'd be wrong in thinking Waianae is soft. 

4. In Conclusion 

These are some of the areas newcomers to Hawaii are told are dangerous. All are on the western part of Oahu, but only Waianae is truly the West Side. Don't let some townie convince you that Kunia is the West Side. Ewa Beach and Waiaphu are sometimes referred to as the South Side, though not as often as Waianae is called the West Side. 

I'd say Waianae is without a doubt the roughest area, followed by Waipahu in second place and Ewa Beach in third. But all of these areas have their charm. Waianae is naturally beautiful. The beach, the mountains, the real people of the real Hawaii. Waipahu is a diverse town with great food. And Ewa Beach is the capital of Hawaii.

I've not spent enough time in Kalihi, Wahiawa, Halawa, Palolo, etc. to give a deep analysis, but maybe next time I'll cover the ""nicer"" areas of Oahu like Kapolei or the really nice areas like Hawaii Kai. Or maybe the East Side or the North Shore or Kaimuki or something. I'll probably do the Laie area. That's a whole different island as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, thanks for reading.

I have lived on Oahu for 12 years. I came here when I was 20.

People who come here always inevitably ask if there are areas to avoid. Well...maybe not always, because a lot of people think Hawaii is one big beach town and don't know that life happens here too. 

Anyway, having spent a lot of time in three of the areas considered most ""dangerous"" on Oahu, here are my impressions of Ewa Beach, Waipahu, and Waianae. (Pls excuse formatting, I'm on mobile)

1. Ewa Beach

The real Ewa Beach. Hanakahi Street, Hau Bush, Papipi Road, Silva's, etc. Because a lot of people say ""Ewa Beach"" when they mean Ocean Pointe or Ewa Gentry. I've heard stories that back before the Gentry-fication of the area, Ewa Beach was rough. I have a good friend who, back in the 90s, had just moved to Hawaii and was set to go to Campbell. Apparently, a security guard at the school told his mom she might want to rethink that decision, as a nerdy Haole boy might not fare well at that particular school. That friend ended up going to Radford.

Today, while Ewa Beach definitely still has a reputation, I get the feeling that it has calmed down a lot. I think this is due to the expansion of greater Ewa and the influx of so many new people. Back then, Ewa Beach was isolated. It was the end of the road. Nowadays, it is a neighborhood in a much larger population center.

Ewa Beach certainly feels different from greater Ewa. It's a lot older, more local, and more ""neighborhoody."" It has an identity that one immediately recognizes as Ewa Beach after living here for a certain amount of time. And you can always recognize an Ewa Beach guy. I don't know how, but you can. And if you can't recognize it, you'll know it in time, because Ewa Beach people always let you know they're from Ewa Beach. 

There are still stories about robberies, fights, and other unfortunate events that one hears coming out of Ewa Beach, but I would absolutely not consider it a very ""dangerous"" area. Rough? Sure, in some places. There were just some robberies and assaults down there. But I've never felt in grave danger being down there. Just cautious about my surroundings. 

Ewa Beach is definitely an interesting place. It's a perfect encapsulation of the tension Oahu feels between the old and the new. It's a town with an old reputation for lawlessness that has lost much of its grit because of rapid Gentry-fication. 

You know those old guys who you know were badass fighters in their youths? The guys who have grown overweight, are gray-haired, and who like to regale you with crazy stories from 30 years ago? They aren't as fearsome as they once were, but you still wouldn't want to be on their bad side and so you respect them. That, to me, is Ewa Beach.

2. Waipahu 

Go to Don Quijote and count how many languages you hear. English. Filipino. Ilocano. Marshallese. Samoan. Chuukese. Filipino. Ilocano. Filipino. Welcome to Waipahu. 94 Block.

For those who don't know, Waipahu is an old mill town that used to process a lot of sugar cane. It's not a beach town like Ewa Beach or Waianae. It's like a suburb of a suburb of Town (""Honolulu""). I mean suburb not in the sense of Suburbia, but in the sense of a town somewhat in the orbit of a larger city. I used to hate going there because it felt so congested, and then they started building the rail and I hated it even more.

Now, however, after having worked there for about a year, I love Waipahu. Old Waipahu town, from about Kunia road all the way to Waipahu High School. Yes, I know, Kunia, Waipio, and Waikele exist, but I mean Waipahu Waipahu.

It's gritty. It's historic. It can certainly be sketchy, and it's even menacing in places. I had a friend who lived on Pupuole Street, and he told me many stories about the nighttime activities in the neighborhood. Every time I went to visit him there, my head was on a swivel. 

Then there's Aniani. Oh man. It's such a small neighborhood, really just a street, but it has a reputation for being pretty hectic. I've never hung out there, but I've taken rides down there and it's pretty wild. Casual fire starting, trash everywhere, sneakers hanging from power lines, addicts pushing shopping wagons full of ""found"" goods, etc.

My boss was born and raised in Waipahu, and when I asked her about Aniani, she told me it's always been Aniani. I even heard nobody used to deliver food there because it was too dangerous. That said, I think part of this was probably due to how tight that street is and how you have to turn around at the end to get out. 

Waipahu transit station? Sweet old Filipina tutus and zombies. Times shoppers. People just passing through to get their TB shots at the Civic Center. Others passed out on the bus stop benches.

Waipahu is frequently in the news for robberies, break-ins, and other unpleasant happenings. There are a lot of homeless, many of whom are, unfortunately, addicted to drugs. I worked in a medical office in the area and we had many incidents with public disturbances, including public nudity, public masturbation, and other such quirky occurrences. 

That said, there is a beauty to Waipahu. I love its diversity. It is a kind of entry point for many new Hawaii residents, especially from the Philippines, but also from Samoa, the Marshall Islands, Chuuk, etc. Mom and Pop shops, restaurants, barber shops, medical offices, and all manner of businesses line Farrington Highway. Waipahu feels unique among other Oahu towns because of its ethnic composition. These cultures give Waipahu a different kind of flavor than places like Waianae or Kapolei. The only other place I imagine has a similar vibe is Kalihi, but I haven't spent much time there. 

Waipahu is very dense, as it is an immigrant town with multiple generations often living in the same small apartments. Familial living is the norm in Hawaii, but in Waipahu this is even more prevalent. It's not just parents, grandparents, and children -- it's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, cousins, uncles, and aunties. 

Is Waipahu dangerous? It certainly feels more gritty than Ewa Beach, and one certainly should take certain precautions in certain parts of the town. It's like...you're unlikely to be shot at, but there are places there where you wouldn't necessarily be surprised to see people with guns. I guess it can be dangerous, but I feel like if you know the town and how to navigate it, you'll be fine. Waipahu is certainly not Detroit, but it ain't Mililani either (Mililani seems to be becoming more like Waipahu though from what I've been seeing in the news). Overall, Waipahu is one of my favorite places on the island.

(Take a shot for every time I write the word ""certainly"")

3. Waianae

This is the one you've been waiting on. The West Side. 96792. The Waianae Coast. If you're scared, just stay in Kapolei. 

For convenience, I will refer to the whole Coast as Waianae. In reality, there are differences between Nanakuli, Maili, Waianae, and Makaha. A quick impression: 

- Nanakuli feels very Hawaiian. The whole Coast is very Hawaiian, but Nanakuli in particular feels very Hawaiian. 

- Maili feels like...I don't know, a kind of middle ground? Sea Country (a newer housing development, for those not in the know) is there, but it's tucked away in the back. Almost the exact opposite of Ewa Beach, where the new part is in the front. I'd say Maili feels very residential.

- Waianae proper is the heart of Oahu's Wild West. Lots of stores, food places, and other businesses.

- Makaha is country. Not a lot of stuff to buy, but a lot to explore. Far less dense than the other three towns.

I‚Äôd like to bring some gifts from home for the office I‚Äôll be working at + cool teachers/friends I meet along the way.

Looking for any suggestions or ideas of Hawaii-specific things (or American tbh, I‚Äôve already gotten advice from someone that Costco vitamins would be a good gift) that Koreans would enjoy. I‚Äôm already thinking of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts and kona coffee grounds.

1718,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, love",Abercrombie outburst highlights tensions with Gov. Green Nominees,"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/02/18/hawaii-news/abercrombie-outburst-highlights-stress-with-gov-green-nominees/

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

For nominees, he said, ‚Äúyou are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you‚Äôve done in your career are going to come out.‚Äù",2023-02-19 06:21:28+00:00
1719,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

For nominees, he said, ‚Äúyou are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you‚Äôve done in your career are going to come out.‚Äù",2023-02-19 06:21:28+00:00

I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning.

1731,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, love","""Dangerous"" Areas of Oahu: A Guest's Perspective","Aloha.

I have lived on Oahu for 12 years. I came here when I was 20.

People who come here always inevitably ask if there are areas to avoid. Well...maybe not always, because a lot of people think Hawaii is one big beach town and don't know that life happens here too. 

Anyway, having spent a lot of time in three of the areas considered most ""dangerous"" on Oahu, here are my impressions of Ewa Beach, Waipahu, and Waianae. (Pls excuse formatting, I'm on mobile)

1. Ewa Beach

The real Ewa Beach. Hanakahi Street, Hau Bush, Papipi Road, Silva's, etc. Because a lot of people say ""Ewa Beach"" when they mean Ocean Pointe or Ewa Gentry. I've heard stories that back before the Gentry-fication of the area, Ewa Beach was rough. I have a good friend who, back in the 90s, had just moved to Hawaii and was set to go to Campbell. Apparently, a security guard at the school told his mom she might want to rethink that decision, as a nerdy Haole boy might not fare well at that particular school. That friend ended up going to Radford.

Today, while Ewa Beach definitely still has a reputation, I get the feeling that it has calmed down a lot. I think this is due to the expansion of greater Ewa and the influx of so many new people. Back then, Ewa Beach was isolated. It was the end of the road. Nowadays, it is a neighborhood in a much larger population center.

Ewa Beach certainly feels different from greater Ewa. It's a lot older, more local, and more ""neighborhoody."" It has an identity that one immediately recognizes as Ewa Beach after living here for a certain amount of time. And you can always recognize an Ewa Beach guy. I don't know how, but you can. And if you can't recognize it, you'll know it in time, because Ewa Beach people always let you know they're from Ewa Beach. 

There are still stories about robberies, fights, and other unfortunate events that one hears coming out of Ewa Beach, but I would absolutely not consider it a very ""dangerous"" area. Rough? Sure, in some places. There were just some robberies and assaults down there. But I've never felt in grave danger being down there. Just cautious about my surroundings. 

Ewa Beach is definitely an interesting place. It's a perfect encapsulation of the tension Oahu feels between the old and the new. It's a town with an old reputation for lawlessness that has lost much of its grit because of rapid Gentry-fication. 

You know those old guys who you know were badass fighters in their youths? The guys who have grown overweight, are gray-haired, and who like to regale you with crazy stories from 30 years ago? They aren't as fearsome as they once were, but you still wouldn't want to be on their bad side and so you respect them. That, to me, is Ewa Beach.

2. Waipahu 

Go to Don Quijote and count how many languages you hear. English. Filipino. Ilocano. Marshallese. Samoan. Chuukese. Filipino. Ilocano. Filipino. Welcome to Waipahu. 94 Block.

For those who don't know, Waipahu is an old mill town that used to process a lot of sugar cane. It's not a beach town like Ewa Beach or Waianae. It's like a suburb of a suburb of Town (""Honolulu""). I mean suburb not in the sense of Suburbia, but in the sense of a town somewhat in the orbit of a larger city. I used to hate going there because it felt so congested, and then they started building the rail and I hated it even more.

Now, however, after having worked there for about a year, I love Waipahu. Old Waipahu town, from about Kunia road all the way to Waipahu High School. Yes, I know, Kunia, Waipio, and Waikele exist, but I mean Waipahu Waipahu.

It's gritty. It's historic. It can certainly be sketchy, and it's even menacing in places. I had a friend who lived on Pupuole Street, and he told me many stories about the nighttime activities in the neighborhood. Every time I went to visit him there, my head was on a swivel. 

Then there's Aniani. Oh man. It's such a small neighborhood, really just a street, but it has a reputation for being pretty hectic. I've never hung out there, but I've taken rides down there and it's pretty wild. Casual fire starting, trash everywhere, sneakers hanging from power lines, addicts pushing shopping wagons full of ""found"" goods, etc.

My boss was born and raised in Waipahu, and when I asked her about Aniani, she told me it's always been Aniani. I even heard nobody used to deliver food there because it was too dangerous. That said, I think part of this was probably due to how tight that street is and how you have to turn around at the end to get out. 

Waipahu transit station? Sweet old Filipina tutus and zombies. Times shoppers. People just passing through to get their TB shots at the Civic Center. Others passed out on the bus stop benches.

Waipahu is frequently in the news for robberies, break-ins, and other unpleasant happenings. There are a lot of homeless, many of whom are, unfortunately, addicted to drugs. I worked in a medical office in the area and we had many incidents with public disturbances, including public nudity, public masturbation, and other such quirky occurrences. 

That said, there is a beauty to Waipahu. I love its diversity. It is a kind of entry point for many new Hawaii residents, especially from the Philippines, but also from Samoa, the Marshall Islands, Chuuk, etc. Mom and Pop shops, restaurants, barber shops, medical offices, and all manner of businesses line Farrington Highway. Waipahu feels unique among other Oahu towns because of its ethnic composition. These cultures give Waipahu a different kind of flavor than places like Waianae or Kapolei. The only other place I imagine has a similar vibe is Kalihi, but I haven't spent much time there. 

Waipahu is very dense, as it is an immigrant town with multiple generations often living in the same small apartments. Familial living is the norm in Hawaii, but in Waipahu this is even more prevalent. It's not just parents, grandparents, and children -- it's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, cousins, uncles, and aunties. 

Is Waipahu dangerous? It certainly feels more gritty than Ewa Beach, and one certainly should take certain precautions in certain parts of the town. It's like...you're unlikely to be shot at, but there are places there where you wouldn't necessarily be surprised to see people with guns. I guess it can be dangerous, but I feel like if you know the town and how to navigate it, you'll be fine. Waipahu is certainly not Detroit, but it ain't Mililani either (Mililani seems to be becoming more like Waipahu though from what I've been seeing in the news). Overall, Waipahu is one of my favorite places on the island.

(Take a shot for every time I write the word ""certainly"")

3. Waianae

This is the one you've been waiting on. The West Side. 96792. The Waianae Coast. If you're scared, just stay in Kapolei. 

For convenience, I will refer to the whole Coast as Waianae. In reality, there are differences between Nanakuli, Maili, Waianae, and Makaha. A quick impression: 

- Nanakuli feels very Hawaiian. The whole Coast is very Hawaiian, but Nanakuli in particular feels very Hawaiian. 

- Maili feels like...I don't know, a kind of middle ground? Sea Country (a newer housing development, for those not in the know) is there, but it's tucked away in the back. Almost the exact opposite of Ewa Beach, where the new part is in the front. I'd say Maili feels very residential.

- Waianae proper is the heart of Oahu's Wild West. Lots of stores, food places, and other businesses.

- Makaha is country. Not a lot of stuff to buy, but a lot to explore. Far less dense than the other three towns.

But let's proceed with the conversation. 

This is the area most people who aren't from Hawaii first hear about when they ask what the most dangerous part of the island is or where to stay away from. Sure, they'll hear about Kalihi. They'll hear about Wahiawa and Waipahu. But Waianae is different.

Waianae is isolated. One way in, one way out. It's far removed from the sprawl that starts in Kapolei and ends roughly somewhere after Hawaii Kai. It's closed off. This isolation is a kind of double-edged sword: on the one hand, it ensures that Waianae stays Waianae, but on the other hand, it concentrates a lot of the darker aspects of Waianae to that region. 

I was once one of those new Hawaii residents, but my knowledge of Waianae was gained from Google prior to moving to Hawaii. When I arrived in Kapolei, a family member living here took me to Waianae shortly after my arrival. I was shocked. I saw homeless tents all along the road. I saw liquor stores and big lifted trucks. I smelled weed literally everywhere. I saw lots of cops in certain parts. I saw a population that looked different from the people I had just seen in Kapolei. 

12 years later, I still see all of that, but I see Waianae for what it truly is: a community. 

The thing about Waianae is that it's not just local, it's Hawaiian (but with a whole lotta Portuguese last names). This makes it different than somewhere like, say, Pearl City or Nuuanu. Those places have plenty of locals, but ethnically speaking, these areas are more Filipino and/or Japanese. 

Waianae, on the other hand, has the highest concentration of Kanaka Maoli on Oahu, which means that local culture there is dominated by Hawaiian culture. This is where you find Hawaiian immersion schools, Hawaiian murals, and so forth. There are non-Hawaiians who live in Waianae, but the historical structure of the community is rooted in old Hawaiian culture. 

I used to work at the Comp (if you know, you know). And it was at the Comp where I first learned just how strong of a community Waianae was. My co-workers would call older Patients uncle and aunty, which is obviously the norm in Hawaii, but they would actually be related to the Patients. Like, ""oh yeah that's my mom's cousin"" or ""that's my dad's older brother."" Everybody seemed to know each other from school, family ties, or some other connection. It was incredible. 

After work, I'd drive home back to Kapolei, and everyone was outside. Everyone was at the beach (shout out to Nanakuli Beach Park), at the parks, taking walks, etc. And as soon as I got back to Kapolei, with its shopping centers and carefully-manicured streets, I felt like I had left something behind in Waianae.

Waianae is rough. I hesitate to use the term ""ghetto,"" because I don't think it's quite ""ghetto."" It's more of a working-class country kind of vibe. It's more rural Mississippi Delta than Southside Chicago. But make no mistake, whatever you call it, Waianae is a rough area. Drugs are everywhere, shootings are not uncommon (I started writing this shortly after the chicken fight shooting and there was just another shooting at Makaha Beach) and scrapping is a beloved pastime. 

It's sad to see the social issues that plague Waianae, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done in that community. But the beautiful thing is that the work is being done by the community. That's the thing about Waianae: nobody there is content with just waiting for the State to help out. Waianae takes matters into its own hands. 

The State won't provide affordable housing for the house houseless? Waianae builds a houseless community.

Healthcare hard to come by in Waianae? Waianae builds a medical center.

Hawaiian language in danger of dying out among the younger generations? Waianae builds Hawaiian language immersion schools. 

They say Waianae is ghetto, but I say it's proud. It's not somewhere the average tourist or newcomer to Oahu is likely to understand, so many may go once and not go back or avoid it altogether. Waianae's reputation is part of the reason it has managed to retain a certain vibe that other parts of Oahu have lost.

Is it dangerous? I hate this question. Waianae is not Rio de Janeiro, but if someone visiting from Iowa were to ask me, I'd tell them that you definitely need to understand that it's not the Hawaii they promote to tourists in the brochures. Someone from the Bronx might not consider it dangerous because there aren't swaths of gangbangers shooting at each other, but they'd be wrong in thinking Waianae is soft. 

4. In Conclusion 

These are some of the areas newcomers to Hawaii are told are dangerous. All are on the western part of Oahu, but only Waianae is truly the West Side. Don't let some townie convince you that Kunia is the West Side. Ewa Beach and Waiaphu are sometimes referred to as the South Side, though not as often as Waianae is called the West Side. 

I'd say Waianae is without a doubt the roughest area, followed by Waipahu in second place and Ewa Beach in third. But all of these areas have their charm. Waianae is naturally beautiful. The beach, the mountains, the real people of the real Hawaii. Waipahu is a diverse town with great food. And Ewa Beach is the capital of Hawaii.

I've not spent enough time in Kalihi, Wahiawa, Halawa, Palolo, etc. to give a deep analysis, but maybe next time I'll cover the ""nicer"" areas of Oahu like Kapolei or the really nice areas like Hawaii Kai. Or maybe the East Side or the North Shore or Kaimuki or something. I'll probably do the Laie area. That's a whole different island as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, thanks for reading.

1732,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, love",Abercrombie outburst highlights tensions with Gov. Green Nominees,"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/02/18/hawaii-news/abercrombie-outburst-highlights-stress-with-gov-green-nominees/

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

For nominees, he said, ‚Äúyou are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you‚Äôve done in your career are going to come out.‚Äù",2023-02-19 06:21:28+00:00
1733,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39+00:00
1734,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, hate","""Dangerous"" Areas of Oahu: A Guest's Perspective","Aloha.

I have lived on Oahu for 12 years. I came here when I was 20.

People who come here always inevitably ask if there are areas to avoid. Well...maybe not always, because a lot of people think Hawaii is one big beach town and don't know that life happens here too. 

Anyway, having spent a lot of time in three of the areas considered most ""dangerous"" on Oahu, here are my impressions of Ewa Beach, Waipahu, and Waianae. (Pls excuse formatting, I'm on mobile)

1. Ewa Beach

The real Ewa Beach. Hanakahi Street, Hau Bush, Papipi Road, Silva's, etc. Because a lot of people say ""Ewa Beach"" when they mean Ocean Pointe or Ewa Gentry. I've heard stories that back before the Gentry-fication of the area, Ewa Beach was rough. I have a good friend who, back in the 90s, had just moved to Hawaii and was set to go to Campbell. Apparently, a security guard at the school told his mom she might want to rethink that decision, as a nerdy Haole boy might not fare well at that particular school. That friend ended up going to Radford.

Today, while Ewa Beach definitely still has a reputation, I get the feeling that it has calmed down a lot. I think this is due to the expansion of greater Ewa and the influx of so many new people. Back then, Ewa Beach was isolated. It was the end of the road. Nowadays, it is a neighborhood in a much larger population center.

Ewa Beach certainly feels different from greater Ewa. It's a lot older, more local, and more ""neighborhoody."" It has an identity that one immediately recognizes as Ewa Beach after living here for a certain amount of time. And you can always recognize an Ewa Beach guy. I don't know how, but you can. And if you can't recognize it, you'll know it in time, because Ewa Beach people always let you know they're from Ewa Beach. 

There are still stories about robberies, fights, and other unfortunate events that one hears coming out of Ewa Beach, but I would absolutely not consider it a very ""dangerous"" area. Rough? Sure, in some places. There were just some robberies and assaults down there. But I've never felt in grave danger being down there. Just cautious about my surroundings. 

Ewa Beach is definitely an interesting place. It's a perfect encapsulation of the tension Oahu feels between the old and the new. It's a town with an old reputation for lawlessness that has lost much of its grit because of rapid Gentry-fication. 

You know those old guys who you know were badass fighters in their youths? The guys who have grown overweight, are gray-haired, and who like to regale you with crazy stories from 30 years ago? They aren't as fearsome as they once were, but you still wouldn't want to be on their bad side and so you respect them. That, to me, is Ewa Beach.

2. Waipahu 

Go to Don Quijote and count how many languages you hear. English. Filipino. Ilocano. Marshallese. Samoan. Chuukese. Filipino. Ilocano. Filipino. Welcome to Waipahu. 94 Block.

For those who don't know, Waipahu is an old mill town that used to process a lot of sugar cane. It's not a beach town like Ewa Beach or Waianae. It's like a suburb of a suburb of Town (""Honolulu""). I mean suburb not in the sense of Suburbia, but in the sense of a town somewhat in the orbit of a larger city. I used to hate going there because it felt so congested, and then they started building the rail and I hated it even more.

Now, however, after having worked there for about a year, I love Waipahu. Old Waipahu town, from about Kunia road all the way to Waipahu High School. Yes, I know, Kunia, Waipio, and Waikele exist, but I mean Waipahu Waipahu.

It's gritty. It's historic. It can certainly be sketchy, and it's even menacing in places. I had a friend who lived on Pupuole Street, and he told me many stories about the nighttime activities in the neighborhood. Every time I went to visit him there, my head was on a swivel. 

Then there's Aniani. Oh man. It's such a small neighborhood, really just a street, but it has a reputation for being pretty hectic. I've never hung out there, but I've taken rides down there and it's pretty wild. Casual fire starting, trash everywhere, sneakers hanging from power lines, addicts pushing shopping wagons full of ""found"" goods, etc.

My boss was born and raised in Waipahu, and when I asked her about Aniani, she told me it's always been Aniani. I even heard nobody used to deliver food there because it was too dangerous. That said, I think part of this was probably due to how tight that street is and how you have to turn around at the end to get out. 

Waipahu transit station? Sweet old Filipina tutus and zombies. Times shoppers. People just passing through to get their TB shots at the Civic Center. Others passed out on the bus stop benches.

Waipahu is frequently in the news for robberies, break-ins, and other unpleasant happenings. There are a lot of homeless, many of whom are, unfortunately, addicted to drugs. I worked in a medical office in the area and we had many incidents with public disturbances, including public nudity, public masturbation, and other such quirky occurrences. 

That said, there is a beauty to Waipahu. I love its diversity. It is a kind of entry point for many new Hawaii residents, especially from the Philippines, but also from Samoa, the Marshall Islands, Chuuk, etc. Mom and Pop shops, restaurants, barber shops, medical offices, and all manner of businesses line Farrington Highway. Waipahu feels unique among other Oahu towns because of its ethnic composition. These cultures give Waipahu a different kind of flavor than places like Waianae or Kapolei. The only other place I imagine has a similar vibe is Kalihi, but I haven't spent much time there. 

Waipahu is very dense, as it is an immigrant town with multiple generations often living in the same small apartments. Familial living is the norm in Hawaii, but in Waipahu this is even more prevalent. It's not just parents, grandparents, and children -- it's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, cousins, uncles, and aunties. 

Is Waipahu dangerous? It certainly feels more gritty than Ewa Beach, and one certainly should take certain precautions in certain parts of the town. It's like...you're unlikely to be shot at, but there are places there where you wouldn't necessarily be surprised to see people with guns. I guess it can be dangerous, but I feel like if you know the town and how to navigate it, you'll be fine. Waipahu is certainly not Detroit, but it ain't Mililani either (Mililani seems to be becoming more like Waipahu though from what I've been seeing in the news). Overall, Waipahu is one of my favorite places on the island.

(Take a shot for every time I write the word ""certainly"")

3. Waianae

This is the one you've been waiting on. The West Side. 96792. The Waianae Coast. If you're scared, just stay in Kapolei. 

For convenience, I will refer to the whole Coast as Waianae. In reality, there are differences between Nanakuli, Maili, Waianae, and Makaha. A quick impression: 

- Nanakuli feels very Hawaiian. The whole Coast is very Hawaiian, but Nanakuli in particular feels very Hawaiian. 

- Maili feels like...I don't know, a kind of middle ground? Sea Country (a newer housing development, for those not in the know) is there, but it's tucked away in the back. Almost the exact opposite of Ewa Beach, where the new part is in the front. I'd say Maili feels very residential.

- Waianae proper is the heart of Oahu's Wild West. Lots of stores, food places, and other businesses.

- Makaha is country. Not a lot of stuff to buy, but a lot to explore. Far less dense than the other three towns.

But let's proceed with the conversation. 

This is the area most people who aren't from Hawaii first hear about when they ask what the most dangerous part of the island is or where to stay away from. Sure, they'll hear about Kalihi. They'll hear about Wahiawa and Waipahu. But Waianae is different.

Waianae is isolated. One way in, one way out. It's far removed from the sprawl that starts in Kapolei and ends roughly somewhere after Hawaii Kai. It's closed off. This isolation is a kind of double-edged sword: on the one hand, it ensures that Waianae stays Waianae, but on the other hand, it concentrates a lot of the darker aspects of Waianae to that region. 

I was once one of those new Hawaii residents, but my knowledge of Waianae was gained from Google prior to moving to Hawaii. When I arrived in Kapolei, a family member living here took me to Waianae shortly after my arrival. I was shocked. I saw homeless tents all along the road. I saw liquor stores and big lifted trucks. I smelled weed literally everywhere. I saw lots of cops in certain parts. I saw a population that looked different from the people I had just seen in Kapolei. 

12 years later, I still see all of that, but I see Waianae for what it truly is: a community. 

The thing about Waianae is that it's not just local, it's Hawaiian (but with a whole lotta Portuguese last names). This makes it different than somewhere like, say, Pearl City or Nuuanu. Those places have plenty of locals, but ethnically speaking, these areas are more Filipino and/or Japanese. 

Waianae, on the other hand, has the highest concentration of Kanaka Maoli on Oahu, which means that local culture there is dominated by Hawaiian culture. This is where you find Hawaiian immersion schools, Hawaiian murals, and so forth. There are non-Hawaiians who live in Waianae, but the historical structure of the community is rooted in old Hawaiian culture. 

I used to work at the Comp (if you know, you know). And it was at the Comp where I first learned just how strong of a community Waianae was. My co-workers would call older Patients uncle and aunty, which is obviously the norm in Hawaii, but they would actually be related to the Patients. Like, ""oh yeah that's my mom's cousin"" or ""that's my dad's older brother."" Everybody seemed to know each other from school, family ties, or some other connection. It was incredible. 

After work, I'd drive home back to Kapolei, and everyone was outside. Everyone was at the beach (shout out to Nanakuli Beach Park), at the parks, taking walks, etc. And as soon as I got back to Kapolei, with its shopping centers and carefully-manicured streets, I felt like I had left something behind in Waianae.

Waianae is rough. I hesitate to use the term ""ghetto,"" because I don't think it's quite ""ghetto."" It's more of a working-class country kind of vibe. It's more rural Mississippi Delta than Southside Chicago. But make no mistake, whatever you call it, Waianae is a rough area. Drugs are everywhere, shootings are not uncommon (I started writing this shortly after the chicken fight shooting and there was just another shooting at Makaha Beach) and scrapping is a beloved pastime. 

It's sad to see the social issues that plague Waianae, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done in that community. But the beautiful thing is that the work is being done by the community. That's the thing about Waianae: nobody there is content with just waiting for the State to help out. Waianae takes matters into its own hands. 

The State won't provide affordable housing for the house houseless? Waianae builds a houseless community.

Healthcare hard to come by in Waianae? Waianae builds a medical center.

Hawaiian language in danger of dying out among the younger generations? Waianae builds Hawaiian language immersion schools. 

They say Waianae is ghetto, but I say it's proud. It's not somewhere the average tourist or newcomer to Oahu is likely to understand, so many may go once and not go back or avoid it altogether. Waianae's reputation is part of the reason it has managed to retain a certain vibe that other parts of Oahu have lost.

Is it dangerous? I hate this question. Waianae is not Rio de Janeiro, but if someone visiting from Iowa were to ask me, I'd tell them that you definitely need to understand that it's not the Hawaii they promote to tourists in the brochures. Someone from the Bronx might not consider it dangerous because there aren't swaths of gangbangers shooting at each other, but they'd be wrong in thinking Waianae is soft. 

4. In Conclusion 

These are some of the areas newcomers to Hawaii are told are dangerous. All are on the western part of Oahu, but only Waianae is truly the West Side. Don't let some townie convince you that Kunia is the West Side. Ewa Beach and Waiaphu are sometimes referred to as the South Side, though not as often as Waianae is called the West Side. 

I'd say Waianae is without a doubt the roughest area, followed by Waipahu in second place and Ewa Beach in third. But all of these areas have their charm. Waianae is naturally beautiful. The beach, the mountains, the real people of the real Hawaii. Waipahu is a diverse town with great food. And Ewa Beach is the capital of Hawaii.

I've not spent enough time in Kalihi, Wahiawa, Halawa, Palolo, etc. to give a deep analysis, but maybe next time I'll cover the ""nicer"" areas of Oahu like Kapolei or the really nice areas like Hawaii Kai. Or maybe the East Side or the North Shore or Kaimuki or something. I'll probably do the Laie area. That's a whole different island as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, thanks for reading.

1735,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, enjoy",Abercrombie outburst highlights tensions with Gov. Green Nominees,"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/02/18/hawaii-news/abercrombie-outburst-highlights-stress-with-gov-green-nominees/

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39+00:00

I‚Äôd like to bring some gifts from home for the office I‚Äôll be working at + cool teachers/friends I meet along the way.

Looking for any suggestions or ideas of Hawaii-specific things (or American tbh, I‚Äôve already gotten advice from someone that Costco vitamins would be a good gift) that Koreans would enjoy. I‚Äôm already thinking of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts and kona coffee grounds.

Being born & raised on the islands sometimes clouds my judgement on these sorts of things so any help is appreciated!!",2024-01-10 03:59:12+00:00

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

For nominees, he said, ‚Äúyou are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you‚Äôve done in your career are going to come out.‚Äù",2023-02-19 06:21:28+00:00

1774,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, comfortable",What are the cheapest studio apartments you can find in Honolulu?,"this question goes out to all those Hawaiian residents or just those knowledgeable about current apartment costs in Honolulu. Planning to move to Hawaii this Summer for a job, I have very reasonable employers who are willing to negotiate my pay and Im just trying to do research on my living costs. Just hoping to get some insight on prices and what to expect with those prices. Im not very high maintenance, as long as I have running hot water, a kitchen and a bathroom Id be very comfortable. Also does anyone know any good sites to look into said apartments?

Edit: I originally had put ""native Hawaiians"" when I just meant residents in my original post, so I apologize for my ignorance. But could we maybe all agree that this is a perfect example that I'm a person who means well but was just in the dark about the whole thing. It doesn't mean I'm not willing to learn though and I'm pretty sure there are lots of others out there like me. I thank all those who accepted my post with compassion and put their best foot forward not to judge but rather teach me instead.",2023-02-05 01:58:39+00:00
