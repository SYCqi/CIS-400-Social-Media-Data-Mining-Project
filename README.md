Regional Attitudes Toward Weather Conditions on Social Media Across the U.S.
============================================================================

Objective: This project aims to analyze how people’s attitudes are affected by various weather conditions across different regions in the United States. By examining social media posts from specific states that represent different climate zones (hot, cold, temperate) we will explore how sentiments vary toward weather conditions (sunny, rainy, snowy,cloudy).
The study will focus on states representing diverse climates to capture a variety of emotional responses—Hot regions: Florida, Hawaii; Cold regions: Alaska, North Dakota; Temperate regions: Kansas, Kentucky. By analyzing posts that mention weather-related keywords, we will use sentiment analysis to classify attitudes (positive, negative, or neutral) and determine whether certain weather conditions are associated with different emotional responses across these regions. This approach will help us understand regional attitudes toward weather conditions and uncover potential climate-based preferences in how people react to various weather experiences.
